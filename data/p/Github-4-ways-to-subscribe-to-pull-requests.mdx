Here are four different ways you can subscribe to pull requests depending on your preferences:

## ‚úâÔ∏è On your email :

To set up GitHub subscriptions on your emails follow those two steps:

- Head over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/settings/notifications">https://github.com/settings/notifications</a>, in Email notification preferences tick Pull Request reviews. (See screenshot)

  <div
    style={{
      display: "flex",
      justifyContent: "center",
      alignItems: "center",
      flexDirection: "column",
    }}
  >

- From the repository, you should click on the top right button 'Watch', then 'Custom', and then tick 'Pull requests'. (see screenshots)

# üì± On your mobile:

To set up notifications directly on your mobile follow those steps:

### Step 1:

Download and sign In in the GitHub app from your mobile on: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/mobile">https://github.com/mobile</a>

### Step 2:

Head over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/settings/notifications">https://github.com/settings/notifications</a> and tick the 'Web and Mobile notifications' in the 'Participating and Watching sections'.

  style={{
    display: "flex",

# üí¨ On Slack:

We have already written a full article about <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-5-github-pull-request-slack-integration">5 GitHub Slack Pull request integrations</a>. Here are two ways you can do to subscribe to pull requests right in Slack:

## 1. Using the official Slack GitHub integration:

### Step 1:

Head over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://slack.github.com/">https://slack.github.com/</a> in order to install the official Slack and GitHub integration.

### Step 2:

On Slack, create a channel and then type in the command: <br></br>
`/github subscribe YourOrganization/YourRepository`

### Step 3:

GitHub should ask you to connect your GitHub account. The last time I did it, they asked for a code to enter.

That's it, now this channel will receive all updates about the pull requests, issues, and comments.

  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    flexDirection: "column",
  }}

  />

</div>

## 2. Using Axolo Slack and GitHub integration:

Axolo is a bidirectionnal integration. For every pull request Axolo will open a Slack channel and archive it automatically whenever you close or merge the pull requests. What's practical is that it invites the right engineers (reviewers, creators, and assignees) to the Slack channel. It's easy to engage in a chat about a specific pull request.

On top of that, Axolo will open an \_axolo channel with notifications for every pull request. Depending on the status of the pull request (draft, to be reviewed, changes requested, closed, merged) it will react with an Emoji. This allows teams to have a high-level view of what's happening in the team.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    flexDirection: "column",
  }}

</div>

Sign up on <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co">Axolo.co</a> with your Slack Workspace.

### Step 2:

Add your GitHub Organization.

### Step 3:

Onboard the engineers on your team.
