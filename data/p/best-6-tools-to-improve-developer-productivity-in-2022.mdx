It's very useful for determining how you divide your time between several clients and tasks.

### <NoFollowLink url="https://justgetflux.com/">F.lux</NoFollowLink> - to protect your eyes from screen fatigue

As developers, we spend a significant amount of time in front of screens. The brightness of a screen can interfere with how our bodies normally work, particularly when it comes to sleep.

F.lux is a color display application that varies based on your needs and the time of day. It will change your screen's color ratios, in particular how much blue light comes from your gadgets, and will protect your eyes.

Natively, most OS have now built-in features to protect your eyes. But F.lux might be a good addition to your toolbox. (I also love DarkReader (the Chrome Extension) to switch the whole internet to dark mode!)

I hope you found some apps that would help you boost your productivity, and if you think we're missing one, just let us know!
