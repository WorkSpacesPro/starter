## Why should you use a pull request template

Pull request templates allow your organizations to have a default text when you create a pull request on GitHub. It is quite useful to make sure to follow a standard process for every pull request and to have a to-do list for the author to check before requesting a review.

The easiest way to add a pull request template to your repository is by adding a file called `pull_request_template.md` in the root of your directory. Itâ€™s a markdown file, so you can use any of the markdown that is available to you. More about markdown in the <a

### Example 6: Open-source to-do list pull request template for GitHub

```
## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

    d. `npm test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `staging` instead.

    b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    c. Describe your changes.

    d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.

**PLEASE REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**

## Bonus: Issue templates for your project

And if you're working with open-source projects, you might need the help of some useful issue templates in your repositories. Recently, GitHub developed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates">multiple issue templates</a>. For example, GitHub users looking to post an issue will face something like this (React example):

<div  style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center'}}>

  <img src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/react-issues.png"
      alt="React template issues in GitHub"
      style={{width:"850px"}}/>
      </div>

### Example 1: Simple GitHub issue template

```
## Expected Behavior


## Current Behavior


## Possible Solution


## How to reproduce (for bugs)

```

### Example 2: Detailed GitHub issue template

```
## I'm submitting a ...

- [ ] bug report
- [ ] feature request

## What is the current behavior?

## If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem

## What is the expected behavior?

## What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?
