## Why should you use a pull request template

A **GitHub pull request template** allows your organization to have a standardized and repeatable default text whenever you create a new pull request. This ensures that every PR has a clear, consistent structure. By providing a predefined checklist, guidelines, and prompts, you’ll see benefits such as:

- Ensuring contributors follow a uniform review process.
- Reducing back-and-forth communication by clarifying expectations upfront.
- Saving time by not having to rewrite the same instructions for each PR.
- Improving overall code quality and maintainability.

As you scale your development team, having a structured approach is essential. Standardization helps prevent confusion and miscommunication. It also ties into the concept of [what is a pull request](https://axolo.co/blog/p/part-1-what-are-github-pull-requests), making sure that everyone on the team understands the expectations and the steps needed before requesting a review.

To implement a **GitHub pull request template**, simply add a file called `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to your repository’s root or `.github/` directory. The template can include checklists, a summary section, testing guidelines, or references to relevant issues. If you’re using **GitHub
multiple pr templates**, you can differentiate them by placing them in the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` folder and selecting the appropriate one when opening a PR.

Also, consider the relationship between pull requests and merge requests. Learn more by checking out the [pull request vs merge request](https://axolo.co/blog/p/pull-request-vs-merge-request) comparison to understand best practices across different platforms.

## Key Components of a Good Pull Request Template

A strong **pr template** should set clear expectations and facilitate a smooth review process. When you build a **GitHubtemplate**, think about including the following elements:

### Clear Title and Description

Your template should prompt the contributor to provide a brief, yet informative, title and a summary describing the purpose of the PR. This helps reviewers quickly understand the context and goals.

### Reference to Related Issues or Tasks

Linking relevant issues or tasks ensures that everyone understands why this PR exists. When you’re using **GitHub project templates**, referencing related issues streamlines project tracking.

### Checklist of Requirements

A well-defined checklist of prerequisites helps authors verify they haven’t missed critical steps. For instance, confirm that tests pass, code is documented, or certain conditions are met. Including these can reduce the number of review cycles.

### Instructions for Testing

Encourage contributors to detail how reviewers can test the changes. This could include information on setup steps, test commands, or even user flows to follow. Having a consistent testing approach keeps quality high.

### Additional Context or Screenshots

Sometimes, a PR is more understandable with added context. Encouraging screenshots, logs, or links to documentation can speed up understanding, especially when onboarding new contributors.

The above components serve as a general blueprint. For an actual **pull request template example**, keep reading as we’ll delve into various templates shortly.

## How to Create a GitHub Pull Request Template

Creating a **GitHub pull request template** involves just a few steps. Before you start, consider leveraging a **GitHub template repository** or **GitHub repository template**. These resources help you jumpstart your standardization process. You can also explore **GitHub create template repository** functionalities to streamline your onboarding process.

### Step 1: Add Your Template File

Create a file named `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` at the root of your repository or within a `.github/` folder. If you’re working with a **GitHub template repository**, start from a template that already includes a PR file. For those who maintain large projects, consider making use of **GitHub multiple pr templates** to handle different use cases (e.g., bug fixes vs. feature additions).

**Example directory structure:**

```
.
└── .github/
    ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
    │   ├── bug_fix_template.md
    │   ├── feature_template.md
    └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

### Step 2: Customize the Template Content

Inside `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, draft your **pr template** content. Include headings, checklists, and references to related issues. For inspiration, refer to a **pull request template example** from this article or from public repositories. Adjust it to your team’s needs, ensuring you’re consistently referencing **GitHub issue template** usage and processes as needed.

### Step 3: Commit and Push

Once you’ve finalized the template, commit and push it. From that point forward, every new pull request will automatically load the default content from your **pr template**. If you’re using **GitHub multiple pr templates**, GitHub will prompt you to choose the appropriate one, ensuring you always start from the correct baseline.

Check out how others incorporate templates by examining **GitHub bug report template** or **GitHubcreate template repository** documentation. These resources can help you standardize more than just pull requests – they help you streamline issues, features, and more.

### Step 4: Iterate and Improve

Your first version of the template might not be perfect. Over time, refine your **GitHub template** by adding new requirements, clarifying instructions, or simplifying steps. Continuous improvement ensures that your team always benefits from the best possible process.

```
## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

    d. `npm test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `staging` instead.

    b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    c. Describe your changes.

    d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.

**PLEASE REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

When implementing a **GitHub pull request template**, watch out for:

1. **Overly Complex Templates:**  
   If the template is too long, contributors may ignore it. Keep instructions concise and meaningful.

2. **Generic Prompts Without Context:**  
   Avoid vague instructions. Instead of “Run tests,” specify which tests or what environment to test in.

3. **Forgetting to Update Templates Regularly:**  
   Projects evolve. Regularly revisit your templates to ensure they still align with best practices and **GitHub code review best practices**.

4. **Not Leveraging GitHub’s Features:**  
   Don’t forget you can combine templates with automated workflows. For instance, use [**GitHub actions on pull request**](https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-4-github-action-slack-integration) triggers to run tests, linting, or security scans automatically.

5. **Ignoring Multiple Templates for Different Use Cases:**  
   Sometimes, a single template doesn’t fit all scenarios. Consider using **GitHub multiple pr templates** to handle bug fixes, new features, and documentation updates differently. Each scenario can have its own **pull request template example**, ensuring maximum relevance.

## Integrating PR Templates into Your Workflow

A PR template is only one piece of the puzzle. Consider integrating it with other parts of your development lifecycle:

- **Project Onboarding:**  
  When setting up a new project, consider using **GitHub create template repository** steps to generate a standardized project framework. This helps new repos start with the right structure, including PR and issue templates.

- **Code Review and Communication:**  
  Encourage the team to use the template consistently. Mention the importance of these templates during onboarding and team syncs. Enhanced consistency leads to faster, more efficient reviews. For more advanced review strategies, explore [code review](https://axolo.co/) best practices.

- **Linking to Documentation:**  
  Within the PR template, link to documentation on coding standards, architectural decisions, or testing guidelines. This empowers contributors to find information quickly.

- **Tie into Existing CI/CD:**  
  Combine your PR template with **GitHub actions on pull request** events. Trigger automatic builds, tests, or security checks as soon as a PR is opened, ensuring faster feedback loops.

By integrating PR templates into all aspects of your workflow, you ensure everyone is aligned, resulting in better collaboration and code quality.

## Bonus: Issue templates for your project

Just as PR templates bring consistency to pull requests, a **GitHub issue template** ensures that anyone reporting a bug or requesting a feature follows a standardized format. Issue templates can guide users and contributors to provide the right details, reducing the time it takes to understand and address problems.

If you’re scaling up your templates strategy, consider creating a **GitHub template** directory that contains both issue and PR templates. You can also check out **feature request template** references at [feature request template](https://axolo.co/blog/p/feature-request-template-best-practices-and-5-examples-to-use-directly) to standardize feature requests as well. Similarly, adopting a **GitHubbug report template** helps streamline how users and contributors raise issues, ensuring enough detail is provided from the start.

## Bonus: Issue templates for your project

And if you're working with open-source projects, you might need the help of some useful issue templates in your repositories. Recently, GitHub developed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates">multiple issue templates</a>. For example, GitHub users looking to post an issue will face something like this (React example):

<div  style={{display:'flex', justifyContent:'center'}}>

  <img src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/react-issues.png"
      alt="React template issues in GitHub"
      style={{width:"850px"}}/>
      </div>

### Example 1: Simple GitHub issue template

```
## Expected Behavior


## Current Behavior


## Possible Solution


## How to reproduce (for bugs)

```

### Example 2: Detailed GitHub issue template

```
## I'm submitting a ...

- [ ] bug report
- [ ] feature request

## What is the current behavior?

## If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem

## What is the expected behavior?
