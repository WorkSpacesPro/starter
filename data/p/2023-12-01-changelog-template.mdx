## ‚ú® New

- GitHub Enterprise Server is live (self-hosted instance of GitHub)
- Workflow to auto-leave a channel after approving a merge request in GitLab is live
- Linear integration: Axolo adds a bookmar to the Linear issue in PR channels
- During the trial period, Axolo will open PR channel for not onboarded author if at least one reviewer is onboarded on Axolo

## üî® Improvements

- We added a button to redirect to app.axolo.co from the Axolo Home in Slack
- User can now self onboard from logging in from app.axolo.co
- Standup triggers same day notification from now on too (it was only working for the next day)

### GitLab:

- When suspending a company on GitLab, we revoke its token
- Axolo was still opening MRs for inactive account in GitLab
- Axolo tells users whenever we get a 401 from GitLab and ask to re-sign in

### Slack:

- Automatically ask to renew Slack OAuth if we have an outdated or revoked token

## üêû Fixes

- Fix bug where new Business users would be assigned to a Professional plan
- Fix GitLab assignees that were not invited in MR channels
- Fix bug with quote and new line from Slack where GitHub and GitLab did not understand that the new line was not within the code fence
- Creating new channels from app.axolo.co was not sending a notification in Axolo team channels (and \_axolo)
