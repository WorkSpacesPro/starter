## 1. Introduction to Incident Reports

### What is an Incident Report?

An incident report is a formal document that records the details of an unexpected event that occurred within a workplace, organization, or other setting. This report typically includes information such as the date, time, and location of the incident, the individuals involved, a description of what happened, and any resulting actions or consequences.

### Why Incident Reports are Important

Incident reports serve several critical functions:

- **Documentation:** They provide a written record of the incident, which can be essential for legal and regulatory purposes.
- **Analysis:** They help organizations analyze incidents to identify patterns and root causes, which can inform preventative measures.
- **Accountability:** They ensure that all parties involved in an incident are accounted for and that their actions are documented.
- **Communication:** They facilitate communication between different departments or stakeholders about what happened and what needs to be done.
- **Improvement:** They help organizations improve safety and operational procedures by learning from past incidents.

By systematically recording and reviewing incidents, organizations can improve their overall safety, efficiency, and compliance with regulations.
