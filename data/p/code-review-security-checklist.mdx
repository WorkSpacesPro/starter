Security is a necessity, not just a feature. In this article, we'll explore the crucial role of code reviews in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. We'll delve into how to align with OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines and effectively integrate these practices into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Additionally, we'll present a practical approach, complete with backend and frontend security checklists, to ensure your code stands up to the highest security standards. If you haven't read, I recommend looking at our [Code review guideline article](https://axolo.co/blog/p/code-review-guideline).

## Principles of Secure Code review

One of the foundational elements of a robust security posture in software development is the implementation of secure code review practices. Central to this is the understanding and application of the OWASP guidelines.

### Understanding the OWASP Guidelines

The [OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)](https://owasp.org/) provides an extensive set of guidelines and best practices aimed at improving software security. The [OWASP Code Review Guide](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_v2.pdf) is particularly significant for developers and security professionals. This guide encompasses a broad spectrum of security considerations, focusing on identifying common vulnerabilities and offering strategies for secure coding.

A pivotal resource within the OWASP framework is the OWASP Top 10, a regularly updated list highlighting the most critical security risks to web applications. This list serves as a starting point for developers to understand the most prevalent security threats and how to mitigate them effectively.

### Integrating Security into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Security in software development transcends beyond being a mere best practice; it's an integral necessity. It's not just the domain of developers but a collective responsibility shared across all roles involved in the software creation process. This holistic approach ensures that security permeates every aspect of the product's lifecycle.

- **Designers:** They lay the foundation by considering security in the design phase, ensuring that the architecture is robust against potential threats.
- **Product Managers:** Responsible for defining the product's roadmap, they prioritize security features and requirements, making sure these considerations are embedded from the outset.
- **Developers:** Their role is critical in implementing secure coding practices, adhering to OWASP guidelines, and actively seeking to mitigate vulnerabilities during code development.
- **Quality Assurance (QA):** QA teams play a pivotal role in identifying security loopholes during testing phases, ensuring that the software not only functions as intended but also remains resilient against security breaches.
- **Operations and Maintenance Teams:** Post-deployment, these teams ensure ongoing security through monitoring, updating, and responding to new threats, thus maintaining the software's integrity over time.

By integrating security across these diverse roles in the SDLC, organizations cultivate a security-first culture. This approach not only enhances the security posture of the software applications but also ingrains a sense of shared responsibility towards security, making it a core aspect of the development ethos.

### How About Human Code Reviews in Detecting Complex Vulnerabilities?

While automated tools are efficient for scanning large codebases and identifying standard vulnerabilities, they often lack the nuanced understanding that comes from human expertise. Manual code review is crucial for:

- **Understanding Context:** Human reviewers can interpret the context and intent behind the code, which is vital for identifying complex security issues.
- **Business Logic Errors:** Manual review is better suited for detecting flaws in business logic, which automated tools may overlook.
- **Code Quality and Maintainability:** Human reviewers can provide insights into code readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

Combining both automated tools and manual review processes ensures a comprehensive approach to code review, enhancing the overall security and quality of the software.

### Dealing with Third-Party Libraries and Dependencies

<Callout title="Third party threats are one of the most common security threats in software development." />
Third party threats are one of the most common security threats in software development. When using a
third party library make your research, is it a library that is being used by many people? When was the
last update made to this project? Do they have automated tests?

- **Best Practices:** Regularly audit and update third-party libraries. Use tools like [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) to identify known vulnerabilities.
- **Risk Management:** Understand the security posture of third-party components and weigh the risks versus benefits.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in Secure Code Review

- **Integration with CI/CD:** Automate security checks as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous assessment of the code.
- **Tools and Techniques:** Utilize tools like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) with security plugins or [GitLab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/) for automated testing and code analysis. We've made [a list of JS code coverage tools](https://axolo.co/blog/p/code-coverage-js-in-2023) you can find.
- **Continuous Security:** Implementing secure code review practices in CI/CD allows for ongoing security verification throughout the development process.

This highlight the need for a **proactive** approach to a secure code review process, ensuring that security is an integral part of the development process rather than an afterthought.
