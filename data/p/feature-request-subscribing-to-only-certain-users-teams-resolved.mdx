## The Problem Stated by the Community:

Problem stated by Jamie Kyle, @[jamiebuilds](https://github.com/jamiebuilds) on [GitHub](https://github.com/integrations/slack/issues/390):

"Within a "monorepo" there can be dozens of teams working in the same codebase.

Subscribing to all of these notifications would get super noisy for a single room. It would be really great if you could subscribe to just a few @users or a @org/team."

## State as of October 2023

## One Notification Channel Per Team: Proposed Solution by Axolo

Axolo allows for the creation of a notification channel per team, ensuring that only relevant updates are sent to the right team members.
Each notifications is then automatically updated depending on:

- It's state (draft, work in progress, closed, merged, etc.)
- The team members involved (reviewers, assignees, etc.)

## Channel per PR: Proposed Solution by Axolo

  Each PR creates its own Slack channel, where discussions are mirrored from Slack to GitHub and
  vice versa. This channel also includes all relevant information about the PR, such as CI/CD
  status.
