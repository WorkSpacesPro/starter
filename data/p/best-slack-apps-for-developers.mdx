We've categorized the best Slack apps for developers. Whether you are working in teams or you just want some bot for yourself we've got you covered in this post. While some of the tools in the list are not specific to developers team we listed them because we think they might still be useful for some.

Before you see the list you can also check out our article on the <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-5-github-pull-request-slack-integration">Top 5 GitHub pull request Slack Integration</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-4-github-action-slack-integration"> the Top 4 GitHub Action Slack integrations</a>.

You'll find a table summary at the end of the file.

## Slack apps for productivity

In this category we'll explore the Slack apps we found that can help tech individuals and tech teams be more productive.

### <u>Axolo</u>

"Every minute trying to understand each other is a minute not spent shipping features".
Axolo focuses on making it easy for developers to talk about a pull request. The result is that pull requests are resolved faster, it's easier to stay on top of PR and there is an increase in focus due to less context switching.

  style={{ width: "500px" }}
/>

#### What we like üëç:

Axolo creates a channel for every pull request and has a deep integration with GitHub. It will share the code comments, code reviews, issues, and even the GitHub actions. As a bonus, there is a /lgtm command that lets you approve pull requests in seconds from Slack.

More about Axolo: <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co">axolo.co</a>.

### <u>Pomodoro tracker</u>

Some people have their pomodoro on their OS but the benefits of having it in Slack is that you can let other people know in your team that you are in a focus mode and that they shouldn't expect you to answer within the next n minutes.

#### What we like üëç:

Simple and powerful. It does what it says it does :).

## Slack project management apps

This category is dedicated to apps that allow you to manage tasks within Slack. Those apps usually allow you to create and assign tasks directly in Slack. It's a crowded space so for brevity we'll just list the one that has been referred to us.

### <u>Linear</u>

Linear defines itself as "The issue tracking tool you'll enjoy using".

<img
  src="https://apichaos.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/LinearSlackAppScreenshot.jpeg"

/>

Linear doesn't have an application listed in the Slack marketplace but you can integrate Slack from your
Linear WorkSpace: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://linear.app/settings/integrations/slack"> Linear</a>.

Linear has a traditional /linear command that allows you to create new issues. Link posted on Slack from linear will be displayed in an organized fashion for people to identify them easily.

#### What we like üëç:

Linear has a way to create a specific channel for a project, sending updates from that project to a channel and making a contextual update on a specific linear project.

### <u>Workast</u>

Workast describes itself as "The missing piece of Slack". They seem to be the best-integrated project management app to Slack we've seen so far. They were built around Slack and is fully featured to be workable on Slack.

<img

  alt="NotionSlackAppscreenshot"
  style={{ width: "500px" }}
/>

The Notion integration allows you to subscribe to changes for a particular page. This is good if you
want to monitor changes in your Notion workspace.{" "}

#### What could be better üò¨:

This integration only updates you on changes. Would be interesting to have workflow automation and more actions you could do directly in Slack.

## Standup Slack app bot

Standup meetings are notorious in tech teams, they allow you to stay sync with your team in a (usually) short and efficient way. A standup meeting is usually a time where you share what you've done the day before and what are your plans for the day. It's simple and allows you to share if you need help, and vice versa, see if there is a colleague to who you can give help to.

### <u>Standup.ly</u>

You can also set it up to get notified of your events coming up during the day.

Here is a list of Slack apps that can automate some of your workflows. They can be useful in numerous ways in order to automate repetitive tasks.

### <u>Zapier</u>

### <u>Automate.io</u>

Automate.io does a similar job to Zapier. You might want to use Automate since they have a cheaper alternative and might have some specific integrations. The first pricing goes for 10$/month.

### <u>Integromat and HotGlue</u>

Two other automation apps. I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you which one to go for, they all seem to be working well. It will probably depend on if you are already one of those tools. Pricing is about equivalent, and they sometimes have different integrations and different levels of integrations.

## Incident apps

I‚Äôve seen numerous incident apps coming up in the past few/months/years. They are usually targeted at bigger companies that have SRE (Site reliability engineers) in the company. They are quite useful to put a methodology in place for any tech and non-tech urgency that one company can have.
They usually have a similar process: you have a command you can do from slack /incident create and you need to fill out a form. In the form you put someone in charge, mention the severity and information you can provide to show the problem. It then spins off a channel and you can discuss how to best resolve it with the right team and people who are automatically invited to that channel.

### <u>Incident.io</u>

Incident.io is a well-funded company by ex-Monzo (banking) employees. They have a 250+ people community in Slack and seem to have happy customers. I‚Äôve seen screenshots of recap of incidents and it looks nice!
