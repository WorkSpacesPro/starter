## What a Slack pull request reminder bot should provide

In order to use the best tool to organize and remind engineers about code review, the ultimate Slack pull request bot must:
notify only the right people (not a whole squad when a specific reviewer is requested),
give context about the code review status, not only the last notification,
send only the notifications that matter,
notify at the right time and understand if engineers are available for review or not.

In this article, we will detail how Axolo was built to become the ultimate Slack pull request reminder following the past four principles.

<CTABanner type="learn" />

### Notifying the right people

Did you know that, according to recent studies, irrelevant notifications can decrease productivity by up to 40%? In the world of software development, where focus is paramount, this can be a significant setback. Axolo addresses this challenge head-on by ensuring that only the relevant members of your team are notified about pull requests.

Our approach at Axolo begins with understanding the unique structure of engineering teams. We recognize that not every team member needs to be involved in every pull request.

To tackle the common issue of notification overload, Axolo creates single-purpose, ephemeral channels. These channels are tailored for each pull request, inviting only the creator and the designated reviewers. This targeted approach means that your engineers receive notifications that are directly relevant to their work, eliminating the distraction of unnecessary alerts and enhancing overall productivity.

### Providing Context Around Code Reviews

This feedback underscores a critical aspect of effective code review management: providing comprehensive context.

In the past, developers often faced the challenge of piecing together information from various notifications and messages to understand the full scope of a pull request. This fragmented approach led to significant context-switching, which can be mentally exhausting and time-consuming. Axolo revolutionizes this process by centralizing all relevant information in a single, dedicated Slack channel for each pull request. This means that every discussion, update, and decision related to the pull request is easily accessible, fostering a more efficient and collaborative review process.

By integrating with Slack, Axolo creates a seamless environment where developers can quickly grasp the status and requirements of a pull request without the need to constantly switch between tools. This approach not only streamlines the review process but also enhances team collaboration, as highlighted by Agency Analytics' experience. With Axolo, code reviews become an integrated, engaging part of the development workflow, rather than a disjointed task.

### Sending only the notifications that matter

Axolo stands out in its technical approach to filtering notifications, ensuring that each team member receives only what's relevant to them. Leveraging advanced algorithms, Axolo analyzes the context and content of each pull request. It then intelligently determines which notifications are pertinent to specific team members, based on their roles and involvement in the project. This means developers aren't bombarded with every update but only get alerted about the changes and requests that require their attention.

A user of Axolo shared their experience: "The notification filtering has been a game-changer for us. It's like having a smart assistant that knows exactly what I need to see and when. This has significantly cut down on noise and helped us focus on what's important." This feedback highlights the effectiveness of Axolo's notification system in enhancing productivity and reducing unnecessary distractions.

By providing this level of customization and relevance in notifications, Axolo not only streamlines the code review process but also respects the time and focus of each developer, ensuring that they can concentrate on their most critical tasks without interruption.

### Pushing notifications at the right time

Timely notifications are crucial in maintaining a productive workflow, and this is where Axolo's customization truly sets it apart from competitors. Understanding that every developer has their unique work pattern, Axolo offers personalized notification settings. This feature allows team members to specify when they are available for code reviews, ensuring that they receive notifications only during these designated times.

This customization means that developers are not interrupted by untimely alerts during their deep work phases or outside of their preferred working hours. Instead, they can fully concentrate on their current tasks, secure in the knowledge that they will be notified about pull requests at a more suitable time. This level of personalization is not just about managing notifications; it's about respecting and adapting to each developer's individual workflow.

Axolo's users often highlight this aspect as a key differentiator. One user remarked, "The ability to set my own notification schedule has been invaluable. It allows me to plan my day more effectively, knowing that I won't be distracted by random alerts. Axolo really understands the needs of developers."

By offering this degree of control over notifications, Axolo not only enhances productivity but also contributes to a more balanced and less stressful work environment.
