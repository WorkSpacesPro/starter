Looking to create your coding style documentation? You're at the right place! Crafting a clear and consistent coding style guide is essential for maintaining code quality, ensuring team collaboration, and facilitating smoother onboarding for new team members. This guide will walk you through the key components of a robust coding style documentation, from project structure to deprecated code management. By addressing the questions asked under each section, you'll be well on your way to establishing a strong foundation for your engineering team's coding practices.

You can start simple with only a few sections, but if you answer everything, you should have a great start, let's dive in!

## Wrapping Up

Hey, you made it to the end! Crafting this coding style documentation is a neat step towards keeping things tidy and understandable in your codebase.

If you're curious about other ways to make things smoother, you might like our [**pull request template**](/p/part-3-github-pull-request-template). It's a handy tool for those code review moments. And if you're ever wondering how your fellow developers feel about the coding environment, our [**developer experience survey**](/p/developer-experience-survey-template) is a chill way to gather some thoughts.

Keep in mind, it's always a good idea to revisit this guide from time to time. Code evolves, and so should our guidelines. Keep rocking that code!
