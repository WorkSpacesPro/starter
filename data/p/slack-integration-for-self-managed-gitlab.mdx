### Cons of using Axolo for a GitLab self-managed instance

Here are a few potential cons of using Axolo:

1. **Cost:** Axolo is not a free tool for team with more than 5 developers (it is $8/dev/mo). This may be a con those with budget constraints. But as our latest studies has shown, Axolo help developers save two hours per week on code reviews, which is a huge time saver for teams.

2. **Dependency on Slack:** As Axolo is a Slack integration, it requires a Slack workspace to function. If your team does not use Slack or prefers to use a different communication tool, Axolo may not be the best fit.

You can find here how to create your Slack application to send notifications from your GitLab instance:

1. Create a Slack app:

   - Create a new Slack app in the Slack API dashboard.
   - Configure the Incoming Webhooks integration to receive notifications from GitLab.

2. Generate a GitLab webhook URL:

   - Go to the project settings in GitLab.
   - Select "Webhooks" from the left-hand menu.
   - Add a new webhook with the Slack webhook URL and the events you want to receive notifications for.

3. Configure GitLab webhook settings:

   - In the webhook settings, add the Slack webhook URL and select the events you want to receive notifications for.

4. Test the Slack integration:

   - Trigger a test event in GitLab.
   - Verify that the notification appears in Slack.

5. Customize notifications:
   - Modify the webhook settings in GitLab or configure the Slack app to modify the notifications before they are sent to Slack.

### Pros of manually creating a GitLab Slack notification integration for a self-managed instance

Here are a few potential pros of manually creating a GitLab Slack notification integration for a self-managed instance:

1. Customization: By creating your own Slack integration, you can customize the notifications to meet your specific needs.

2. Control: By having your own Slack integration, you have more control over how the notifications are sent and received.

3. Learning opportunity: Creating your own integration can be a learning opportunity for your team, allowing them to develop new skills and gain experience with integrating different tools and technologies.

4. Security: By creating your own integration, you have more control over the security of the notifications.

### Cons of manually creating a GitLab Slack notification integration for a self-managed instance

Here are a few potential cons of manually creating a GitLab Slack notification integration for a self-managed instance:

1. Time and resources: Building and maintaining your own Slack integration can be time-consuming and require a significant investment of resources.

2. Complexity: Integrating GitLab and Slack can be a complex process, especially if you're working with multiple teams or have a large number of notifications.

3. Maintenance: Once you've built your Slack integration, you'll need to maintain and update it over time to ensure that it continues to work correctly.

4. Compatibility: Your Slack integration may not be compatible with future versions of GitLab or Slack, which could lead to issues down the road.

5. Security: While creating your own integration can give you more control over security, it also means that you're responsible for ensuring that the integration is secure and doesn't expose sensitive information.

## Conclusion

Setting up Slack notifications for a GitLab self-managed instance can be a valuable way to stay up-to-date on the activity in your repositories. While there are multiple solutions available for integrating GitLab and Slack, we recommend considering either using a third-party app like Axolo or creating your own Slack app.

Using Axolo can be a more cost-effective and simple solution for teams looking to get up and running quickly. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Axolo can help you receive notifications for pull requests, branch conflicts, and deployments in Slack with minimal setup.

But creating your own Slack app can be a more granular solution that gives you more control over how notifications are sent and received. However, this solution can be more difficult and time-consuming to set up and maintain.
