## What is GitHub Branching?

### How to Create a New Branch in GitHub

Creating a new branch in GitHub is a simple yet essential step for managing different features or fixes within your project. By using **GitHub branching**, you can isolate your changes from the main codebase, ensuring that the primary branch remains stable.

#### Steps to Create a New Branch:

1. **Using the GitHub Web Interface**:

   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click the dropdown labeled `main` (or the name of your current branch).
   - Clcik on `New Branch` and enter its name in the text box and click `Create branch`. Your new branch is now ready.

<SubImageText classNameDiv="" classNameText="lg:w-80 ">
  This is what it looks like in the GitHub UI. But I prefer using the terminal.
</SubImageText>

2. **Using Git Command Line**:

   - Use the GitHub switch branch command to move to your desired base branch using:

```bash
git checkout <base-branch-name>
```

     Alternatively, you can use `git switch <base-branch-name>`.

- Create a new branch with:

```bash
git branch <new-branch-name>
```

- Switch to the new branch using:

```bash
git checkout <new-branch-name>
```

     Or, combine these steps with:

```bash
git switch -c <new-branch-name>
```

or (the one I use most)

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

3. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   Once you've created your new branch and made changes, push it to the remote repository with:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <new-branch-name>
```

Now, your GitHub new branch is live and ready for development. This step ensures better collaboration and code management across your team.

### Making Changes in a Branch

Once you've created a **GitHub new branch**, the next step is to start making changes specific to your task or feature. This process is one of the key benefits of **GitHub branching**, as it allows you to isolate your work from the main branch.

#### Steps to Make Changes in a Branch:

1. **Switch to the Branch**:
   Before making changes, use the GitHub switch branch command to ensure you're working in the correct branch:

```bash
git switch <branch-name>
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

2. **Make Changes to Your Files**: Edit your project files as needed.

3. **Stage and Commit Changes**: Once changes are made, stage them for commit using:

```bash
git add <file-name>  # Or use `git add .` to add all changes
```

Then commit your changes with a meaningful message:

```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

4. **Push Changes to GitHub**: Push the changes in your branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

This ensures your team can access your updated branch and continue collaborating.

#### Reviewing and Comparing Changes

After committing your changes, it's important to review and compare them with other branches. GitHub provides tools to **compare branches in GitHub**, enabling you to see differences between your branch and the base branch. This is especially useful for identifying potential issues before starting the merging process.

To compare branches:

- Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
- Go to the **Pull Requests** tab and select "New Pull Request."
- Use the dropdowns to select the branches you want to compare.

This step ensures your branch is ready for integration. Before proceeding with **merging branches in GitHub**, confirm that your updates align with project requirements and don't introduce conflicts. This practice helps maintain code quality and streamlines the collaboration process.

### Understanding Merging in GitHub

Merging is a critical process in GitHub that integrates changes from one branch into another, typically combining feature branches into the main branch. This process ensures that updates made in separate **GitHub branches** are consolidated into a single, unified codebase.

#### What Happens During a Merge?

When you **merge branches in GitHub**, such as performing a GitHub merge branch to master, the changes from the source branch are applied to the target branch. GitHub tracks these updates through a "merge commit," which acts as a record of when the branches were combined. This process can be done through the GitHub web interface or using Git commands.

#### Types of Merging:

1. **Fast-Forward Merge**:

   - If there are no diverging changes between the branches, Git will perform a fast-forward merge, integrating the updates without creating a merge commit.

2. **Three-Way Merge**:
   - When there are divergent histories, Git creates a merge commit to combine the changes. This ensures a clear record of the integration process.

#### Steps to Merge Branches in GitHub:

1. **Compare Branches**:
   Use the **GitHub compare branches** feature to review differences and ensure compatibility between the branches.

2. **Initiate the Merge**:

   - On GitHub, create a pull request to propose merging the changes.
   - Assign reviewers if necessary for code review and approval.

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any)**:
   If conflicts arise, GitHub provides tools to resolve them directly in the web interface or through your local environment. Proper conflict resolution is crucial for a successful **merging branches GitHub** process.

4. **Complete the Merge**:
   Once approved, merge the pull request by merging the branch in GitHub. Optionally, **delete the branch after merge** to keep your repository clean and organized.

#### Why Merging Matters

Merging changes plays a pivotal role in collaboration, as merging branches in GitHub helps teams consolidate changes. It ensures that changes from multiple developers or feature branches are integrated efficiently. Proper use of **GitHub branching** and merging practices keeps your project aligned and minimizes disruptions to the main branch.

<CTABanner type="learn" />

## Why Merge?

Merging is an integral part of version control, allowing teams to consolidate changes from multiple **GitHub branches** into one cohesive codebase. Whether you're working on new features, fixing bugs, or addressing issues, Merging ensures that updates are integrated smoothly without losing any work, a key benefit of the ability to merge branches GitHub provides.

However, merging isn’t always seamless. When changes overlap or conflict, merge conflicts can occur. Understanding how to handle these conflicts is key to successful collaboration and efficient **merging branches in GitHub** workflows.

### Handling Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts happen when Git cannot automatically reconcile changes in two branches. This often occurs when:

- The same file is modified in both branches.
- Changes are made to the same line of code in both branches.
- A file is deleted in one branch but modified in another.

#### Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts:

1. **Identify Conflicts**:

   - Git will notify you of conflicts during a merge attempt. In GitHub, conflicts are highlighted directly in the pull request interface.
   - Locally, Git will mark the conflicting files and insert conflict markers (e.g., `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) into the code.

2. **Review and Edit Conflicts**:

   - Open the conflicting files and decide which changes to keep or how to combine them.
   - Edit the file to remove conflict markers and ensure the code is correct.

3. **Stage and Commit Resolved Files**:

   - After resolving conflicts, stage the updated files:

```bash
git add <conflicted-file>
```

- Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

<SubImageText classNameDiv="" classNameText="lg:w-80 ">
  In code editor such as VSCode, you can see the conflict markers in the file.
</SubImageText>

4. **Complete the Merge**:
   Push the resolved branch to GitHub and finish the merge process.

#### Tips to Avoid and Handle Merge Conflicts:

- Regularly pull updates from the main branch into your working branch to minimize divergence.
- Use **GitHub compare branches** to identify potential conflicts early.
- Communicate with your team to coordinate changes effectively.

By mastering conflict resolution and following best practices for **merging branches in GitHub**, you can keep your development process smooth and collaborative.

   - Alternatively, delete the branch locally and on GitHub:

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

Deleting unused branches reduces clutter and ensures your repository remains organized.

### Restoring a Deleted Branch After Merge (Optional)

If a branch is accidentally deleted after merging, you can ask GitHub to restore deleted branches:

1. **Go to the Repository**:

   - Navigate to your repository and click on the **“Branches”** tab.

2. **Find the Deleted Branch**:

   - Look for the branch under the "Recently Deleted" section (if available).
   - GitHub retains deleted branches for a limited time.

3. **Restore the Branch**:

   - Click the “Restore” button to recover the branch.

4. **Alternatively, Restore Locally**:
   - If you have a local copy, you can push it back to GitHub:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Knowing how to **restore a deleted branch in GitHub** ensures you never lose valuable work, even after cleanup efforts.

## Merge Commits

In GitHub, merge commits are created during the process of integrating one branch into another. Unlike individual commits made within a branch, a merge commit acts as a unique record of the combination of branches, preserving the history of both. It’s an essential feature of **GitHub branching**, providing transparency and traceability in your project’s evolution.

### What Makes Merge Commits Unique?

When merging branches in GitHub, a merge commit:

- **Preserves Context**: Unlike fast-forward merges that skip creating a commit, merge commits maintain the full history of changes, making it clear when and why branches were merged.
- **Tracks Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts are resolved during the merge, the merge commit reflects these resolutions, acting as a single point of reference for the final integrated changes.

### When Are Merge Commits Created?

1. **Three-Way Merges**:

   - Merge commits are automatically created when there are diverging changes between branches. For example, when integrating a **GitHub new branch** with changes back into the main branch after simultaneous updates in both branches.

2. **Pull Requests**:
   - Most pull requests in GitHub result in merge commits, especially when team members collaborate, review, and modify changes before merging.

### Benefits of Using Merge Commits

1. **Historical Clarity**:
   - Merge commits provide a clear timeline of when features were integrated. This is especially useful for teams working on multiple **GitHub branches** concurrently.
2. **Better Debugging**:

   - By reviewing a merge commit, you can trace back to the exact branches and commits involved, making it easier to identify and resolve issues introduced during a merge.

3. **Conflict Documentation**:
   - When resolving conflicts during **merging branches in GitHub**, merge commits act as a log of what changes were accepted and how conflicts were handled.

### Managing Merge Commits

1. **Customizing Merge Commit Messages**:
   - Edit the merge commit message to include details about the branch being merged, the purpose of the merge, and any key notes for future reference.
2. **Deleting and Restoring Branches**:
   - After a merge, it’s a best practice to **delete the branch after merge** to keep your repository organized. However, if needed, you can always **restore a deleted branch in GitHub**.

### Merge Commit vs. Fast-Forward Merge

- **Merge Commit**:
  - Keeps a detailed history, making it ideal for collaborative teams or long-running branches.
- **Fast-Forward Merge**:
  - Skips creating a merge commit when no divergence exists, suitable for quick, linear updates.

By understanding and utilizing merge commits, you can ensure a well-documented, organized, and efficient workflow in your GitHub projects.
