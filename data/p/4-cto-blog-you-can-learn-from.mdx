<br></br>I like the way Tom is opinionated and takes time to share his views and opinions frequently.
Tom MacWright is the founder and CTO of Placemark, a tool for making apps. Follow him on Twitter on @tmcw.

Tom writes an article on average once to twice a month where he shares small bytes updates about his thoughts in a philosophical way. He can also get into specifics and talk about tools and recent trending topics. It’s usually easy to read and full of interesting information.

I liked one of his recent articles where he talks about picking better names and the process of doing so: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://macwright.com/2021/02/17/the-naming-of-things.html">the naming of things</a>
and also his article <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://macwright.com/2021/07/24/hacking-is-the-opposite-of-marketing.html">Hacking is the opposite of Marketing</a>.

He talks about what has moved the needle in his experience and what are the different steps to grow a team from 1 to 100’s.

- Miguel Carranza, who did a YCombinator startup, talks about the differences of VP Of engineering vs CTO. He also mentions how his role has evolved over the years building his startups as a founder and CTO: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://miguelcarranza.es/cto">Evolution of my role as a founder CTO</a>
