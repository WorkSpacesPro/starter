A Stacked Pull Request (PR) is a development workflow strategy where multiple smaller PRs are opened in a specific sequence, each one building upon the previous. This approach allows for easier code review, as each PR contains a manageable chunk of changes, making it simpler for reviewers to understand the context and impact. Stacked PRs are particularly useful in larger projects where a single PR could become overwhelming to review.

If you'd likre to learn more about PRs, I invite you to read [GitHub pull request workflow](https://axolo.co/blog/p/why-your-pull-requests-are-taking-forever).

### When and why should you use stacked PRs?

By breaking down large changes into smaller, manageable units, **stacked PRs** offer numerous advantages over monolithic pull requests. But when exactly should you use stacked pull requests, and why is this strategy beneficial? Letâ€™s explore.

#### When to Use Stacked PRs

1. **Complex Features**: When implementing a feature that requires multiple independent steps, using **stacked pull requests** allows each step to be reviewed and merged sequentially. This approach ensures incremental progress and reduces the risk of errors.
2. **Large Refactoring**: For significant refactors, **git stacked PRs** make it easier to isolate changes, ensuring each piece is tested and reviewed thoroughly without overwhelming reviewers.
3. **Collaboration Across Teams**: When multiple teams or developers work on interconnected changes, **stacked PRs** help maintain a clear dependency chain, avoiding merge conflicts.
4. **Iterative Development**: In agile workflows, where feedback and iterative improvements are common, **PR stacking** ensures that every small change is handled independently while maintaining the integrity of the base branch.

#### Why Use Stacked PRs

1. **Clearer Code Reviews**: **GitHub stacked diffs** allow reviewers to focus on specific parts of the code, making reviews faster and more focused.
2. **Reduced Risk**: Smaller, isolated changes mean fewer surprises during integration. By using **stack PR** practices, the likelihood of bugs and regressions decreases.
3. **Efficient Collaboration**: Teams can parallelize their work, and ensures that dependent branches are handled logically and systematically.
4. **Better Code Quality**: Best practices, like keeping changes small and self-contained, are naturally supported by stacking PRs. This ensures maintainability and readability.

### How Stacked PRs Help

- **Tracking Dependencies**: Developers can easily see which PRs are dependent on others.
- **Faster Iterations**: With clear dependency chains, changes can be merged progressively, speeding up the development cycle.
- **Alignment with GitHub Features**: By learning **how to create a PR in GitHub** for stacked workflows, developers can fully leverage tools like **stacked diffs** to visualize and manage changes efficiently.

### Example Scenarios

Imagine youâ€™re building a new feature with multiple subcomponents. Instead of one massive pull request, you might:

1. Create a base branch and a **stack PR** for the core functionality.
2. Build dependent branches for each subcomponent, using **stacking** to manage relationships.
3. Use tools designed for **GitHub stacked pull requests** to handle reviews, manage conflicts, and ensure a smooth integration process.

By knowing **how to make a PR in GitHub** and employing stacked workflows, teams can reduce review times, improve collaboration, and achieve higher code quality.

## The Importance of Stacked PRs in Streamlined Code Reviews

/>{" "}

Stacked PRs align well with the best practices of having small, manageable changes in each pull request, as advocated by [Google's engineering practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html). Here are some key reasons why this is important:

- **Quick Reviews**: Smaller PRs are reviewed more quickly, making it easier for both developers and reviewers to allocate time.
- **Thorough Reviews**: The limited scope of smaller PRs allows for more thorough and focused code reviews, reducing the chances of overlooking critical issues.
- **Reduced Bug Risk**: With fewer changes to consider, it's easier to assess the impact of the code, thereby minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Less Wasted Work**: In case a PR is rejected, smaller changes result in less wasted effort on both sides.
- **Easier Merging**: Smaller PRs are less likely to result in merge conflicts, simplifying the integration process.
- **Better Design**: The manageable size of small PRs makes it easier to maintain good design and code health.
- **Unblocked Progress**: The self-contained nature of small PRs allows developers to continue working on other tasks while awaiting reviews.

By aligning with the principle of making small, focused changes, Stacked PRs inherently incorporate these best practices into your development workflow.

Managing Stacked PRs in GitHub can be a game-changer for your development workflow. According to a [LogRocket blog post](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-stacked-pull-requests-in-github/), here's a simplified guide on how to do it properly:

### Creating a Stacked PR

1. **Checkout the Base Branch**: Start by checking out the base branch, usually `master` or `develop`.
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
2. **Make Changes and Commit**: Make your changes and commit them.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
   git add hello.txt
   git commit -m 'Add hello.txt'
   ```
3. **Push and Create PR**: Push the changes and create a PR against the base branch.
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch
   ```

### Creating a Dependent PR

1. **Checkout the First Branch**: Make sure you are on the first branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git checkout -b feature-branch-2
   ```
2. **Make Changes and Commit**: Make additional changes and commit them.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, again!" > hello2.txt
   git add hello2.txt
   git commit -m 'Add hello2.txt'
   ```
3. **Push and Create PR**: Push the changes and create a PR. This PR will be dependent on the first one.
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch-2
   ```

### Merging Stacked PRs

- **Direct Merge**: Use the "Merge" option to maintain the commit history.

## Best practices for reviewing stacked PRs

- **Labeling**: Label the PR as 'Stacked' to avoid confusion.
