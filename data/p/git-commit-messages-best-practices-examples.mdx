Check out the [Git Documentation on Commit Messages](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines "nofollow noopener noreferrer") for more information.

Following best practices in writing commit messages helps keep the repository organized, fosters clearer communication, and improves overall productivity for the entire team.

## Part 1: Understanding Git Commit Messages

### What is a Git Commit Message?

A Git commit message is a short note that goes with each commit in a Git repository. It shows what was changed and explains why those changes were made, serving as an important piece of documentation in your version control process.

- **Definition and Purpose**: Every commit message clarifies the motivation behind a particular change, helping current and future developers understand the reasoning behind edits when they look back at the project’s history.

  - [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

- **Anatomy of a Commit Message**: Generally, a well-written commit message has three parts: a subject line, a body, and a footer. The subject line sums up the changes, the body dives into the details, and the footer can include extra data like issue IDs or references.
  - [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

Providing this level of detail is particularly helpful when dealing with complex projects, since it clarifies why certain paths were taken. Maintaining informative commit messages makes your version history a valuable resource for the entire team.

### Why Git Commit Messages Matter

Beyond day-to-day coding tasks, commit messages play a significant role in the health of a software project:

- **Streamlining Code Reviews**: Explaining the scope and purpose of changes helps reviewers provide better feedback.
- **Easier Debugging and Troubleshooting**: A well-documented commit history accelerates the process of finding when and how bugs were introduced.
- **Project Onboarding**: New contributors gain insights into the evolution and decision-making behind the code.
- **Workflow Automation**: Many CI/CD pipelines rely on commit messages for actions like generating changelogs or deploying features.

By consistently writing informative commit messages, developers keep the repository’s history an asset rather than a hindrance.

## Part 2: Structure of a Git Commit Message

### Subject Line

Each commit message starts with a subject line that briefly captures the essence of your changes. It gives teammates a quick snapshot of the commit’s purpose.

- **Concise Summary (50 characters max)**: Keep your subject line short—ideally no more than 50 characters—so it’s easy to read in various Git tools.
  - [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

### Body

The body of your commit message can include technical details, design reasons, or other relevant background that shaped the changes you made.

- [Writing Good Commit Messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

- **Referencing Issues or Pull Requests**: If possible, mention any related issues or PRs to provide additional context and keep the broader discussion linked.

  - [Referencing Issues in Commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

- **Paragraph Breaks**: Use distinct paragraphs for different points to maintain clarity. This makes it easier for others to scan and understand your message.
  - [Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

### Footer

In the footer, you can list any relevant metadata:

(See also [Sign-off in Commit Messages](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s "nofollow noopener noreferrer") for more details.)

- **Signed-off-by**: Some teams require a “Signed-off-by” line in the footer. This is particularly important for projects adhering to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
  - [Git Documentation on Sign-offs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#_signing_off_commits "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

## Part 3: Writing Effective Git Commit Messages

### Tips for Crafting Clear and Concise Messages

Clear and concise commit messages can make your codebase significantly easier to maintain and review. Below are some suggestions:

- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague text. Summarize the change precisely and mention why it was needed.
  - [Effective Commit Messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages "nofollow noopener noreferrer")
- **Active Voice & Present Tense**: Opt for a direct, present-tense style (e.g., “Fix bug” rather than “Fixed bug”). It’s more straightforward and common in version control logs.
  - [Active Voice in Commit Messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#active "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

### The Imperative Mood

Many teams recommend writing commit messages in the imperative mood. It keeps messages consistent and clearly states the action the commit will take when applied.

- **Why Imperative Mood Matters**: Short commands like “Add” or “Fix” set an easy-to-read standard.
  - [Imperative Mood in Git Commit Messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative "nofollow noopener noreferrer")
- **Examples**: “Add new feature,” “Fix layout bug,” etc.
  - [Sample Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

  classNameDiv="mx-10 lg:mx-20"
  classNameImage=""
  width={2808}
  height={1666}
/>

### Using Markdown for Formatting

Markdown is a straightforward markup language that helps format commit messages, making them more visually appealing.

- **Bullet Points & Code Blocks**: Bullets can break down changes into clear steps, while code blocks showcase snippets cleanly.

  - [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

- **Improved Formatting**: Adopting Markdown features can improve how others read and digest your commit details.

## Part 4: Git Commit Message Best Practices

<ImageContainer
  alt="commit_messages_get_less_informative.png"
  src="/blog/static/images/commitmessages/1. commit_messages_get_less_informative.png"
  classNameDiv="mx-10 lg:mx-20"
  classNameImage=""
  width={2294}
  height={1252}
/>

Crafting strong commit messages blends clarity, brevity, and structure. Below are several tried-and-true best practices.

### Keep Messages Short but Descriptive

Aim for a concise message that still conveys the essential changes. Many teams recommend a subject line of up to 50 characters.

### Separate Subject and Body with a Blank Line

Placing a blank line between the subject and the body ensures better readability and compatibility with various Git tools.

### Use the Body to Explain the “What” and “Why,” Not the “How”

Focus on the reason behind the change rather than the implementation details. The code itself shows how something is done.

### Reference Issues and Pull Requests

Linking an issue or PR number helps with traceability, so everyone knows the broader discussion.

### Capitalize the Subject Line

This simple convention makes each commit message look cleaner.

### Avoid Ending the Subject with a Period

It’s unnecessary, and skipping it maintains a uniform style.

### Wrap the Body at 72 Characters

A 72-character line width is typical, keeping messages neatly formatted in various tools.

#### Examples of Good vs. Bad Commit Messages

- **Good**:

  ```plaintext
  Subject: Fix null pointer exception in login

  Body:
  Resolved a null pointer error occurring when users log in without credentials.
  Added validation to check for null values before processing requests.
  Fixes issue #123.
  ```

- **Bad**:

  ```plaintext
  Subject: Fix bug

  Body:
  fixed the bug
  ```

## How to Set Up a Git Commit Message Template

Using a template helps your team consistently follow a **git commit message format**, preventing confusion and making it simpler to **update commit message** guidelines if needed.

1. **Create a Template File**

   - Make a file called `commit-template.txt` in your project.
   - Include a structure, for example:

     ```
     Subject (50 chars max):

     Body (why this change? details about changes made):

     Footer (issue references, co-authors, etc.):
     ```

2. **Configure Git to Use the Template**

   - Set the template globally:
     ```bash
     git config --global commit.template path/to/commit-template.txt
     ```
   - Or just for one project:
     ```bash
     git config commit.template path/to/commit-template.txt
     ```

3. **Validate the Template**
   - Test a commit to ensure you’re prompted with the template.
   - If your team regularly discusses [pull request vs merge request](https://axolo.co/blog/p/pull-request-vs-merge-request "nofollow noopener noreferrer"), you might also provide guidance in the template about referencing these processes.

A **commit message template** is handy for teams practicing **semantic commits** or any strict **git commit message convention**. It also encourages **writing good commit messages** by reminding everyone about critical elements like referencing tickets or giving a clear **git commit description**. If inconsistencies arise, prompt teammates to **change commit message** strategies or **fix commit message** mistakes as necessary.

Tools with a **git view commit message** function let you review your template-based messages before pushing them. Whenever your style changes, it’s easy to **update commit message** formatting by refining the template.

## Part 6: Automating Git Commit Messages

Automation tools help maintain consistent **github commit messages** standards, so every commit message remains clear and uniform.

### Tools for Enforcing Commit Message Standards

- **Commitlint**: Checks if messages follow certain formats (like conventional commits).  
  [Commitlint Documentation](https://commitlint.js.org/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

  <ImageContainer
    alt="Commit lint"
    src="/blog/static/images/commitmessages/7. Commit lint screenshot.png"
    classNameDiv="mx-10 lg:mx-20"

## Part 7: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Even with guidelines, it’s easy to slip into bad habits. Here are some frequent pitfalls:

### Vague Commit Messages

Phrases like “update code” or “fix stuff” don’t explain anything. Be precise about the change and its motivation.

### Overly Detailed Commit Messages

On the flip side, massive blocks of text can obscure the main idea. Strike a balance between clarity and brevity.

### Ignoring the Subject Line

Always give a clear, concise subject line. This is the first thing people see and should summarize the commit at a glance.

By avoiding these common errors, you’ll maintain a clean, navigable history.

## Part 8: Git Commit Message Conventions

Conventions add clarity to your project’s commit history, simplifying how changes are categorized and understood.

### Conventional Commits

A lightweight format specifying commit types (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`) and encouraging structured messages.  
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

### Semantic Commit Messages

Align your commit messages with **semantic commits**. This approach automates version bumps when you release.  
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/ "nofollow noopener noreferrer")

### Customizing Commit Message Guidelines for Your Team

Adopt existing formats or tailor them to your workflow. The goal is to keep messages uniform and easy to parse. A **commit convention** can unify everyone’s approach.
