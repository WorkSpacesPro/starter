## Why Code Reviews Matter

Before dissecting the typical code review mistakes, let's emphasize why code reviews matter so much in any development life cycle. Here are a few critical benefits of code reviews:

1. **Ensures Code Quality**  
   By catching coding mistakes during peer review, you can substantially reduce the risk of bugs in production. This early feedback loop helps maintain a healthy, consistent codebase.

2. **Promotes Team Alignment**  
   When everyone routinely reviews each other's code, knowledge gets shared, and developers gain insights into different parts of the system. This fosters team coherence and fewer code review conflicts.

3. **Encourages Best Practices**  
   Code reviews serve as a platform to reinforce code reviews best practices. Senior developers can guide junior developers on common coding mistakes, security considerations, and performance optimizations.

4. **Reduces Overall Costs**  
   The costs of debugging code mistakes skyrocket once software is in production. Systematic code reviews help identify issues early and minimize rework down the road.

5. **Builds a Stronger Feedback Culture**  
   Constructive reviews build trust and an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas, discussing code review challenges, and focusing on continuous improvement.

Ultimately, an organized code review ([read more](https://axolo.co/)) process—whether it's done via manual code review or enhanced with automated code review—pays huge dividends, especially in complex projects. By ensuring the right checks, you'll catch coding mistakes, mitigate future issues, and enhance team collaboration.

## Common Code Review Mistakes Developers Make

Despite the benefits of code reviews, it's all too easy to slip into inefficient or unproductive practices. Below are the core code review mistakes that commonly derail teams, each followed by actionable fixes.

### Overlooking Code Standards

#### Mistake: Failing to adhere to coding guidelines and standards.

Among the most pervasive code review mistakes is ignoring established coding conventions. Each development team typically has a style guide—either an internal document or a popular industry standard. However, when reviewers don't enforce these guidelines consistently, coding mistakes that violate style or format can slip through, creating fragmentation and even code review conflicts over time.

#### Solution: Establish clear coding standards and use linters/formatters to automate checks.

- **Document Your Guidelines**  
  Create or adopt a widely recognized style guide (e.g., Airbnb for JavaScript) to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Automate with Linters**  
  Incorporate linting tools, like ESLint or RuboCop, directly into your CI pipeline for immediate feedback on style-based code mistakes.
- **Reference Standards in PR Templates**  
  Remind developers about your coding standards by linking them within pull request templates.

### Reviewing Only Newly Added Code

#### Mistake: Focusing solely on new or changed code can lead to a fragmented understanding of the codebase.

It's tempting to zero in exclusively on fresh diffs. While this approach might seem time-efficient, it risks overlooking how new changes integrate with existing logic or architecture. This siloed review can lead to overlooked code mistakes that surface much later.

#### Solution: Review the entire codebase context to ensure that new changes integrate seamlessly with existing code.

- **Expand the View**  
  Many Git platforms let you expand surrounding lines in a diff. Use this to evaluate the context of the changes.
- **Cross-File Checks**  
  If a pull request touches multiple areas, glance through all relevant files to catch cross-cutting coding mistakes.
- **Encourage Discussion**  
  If something seems off or ambiguous, ask questions in the code review comments to avoid larger code review conflicts later.

---

### Focusing Only on Syntax, Not Logic

#### Mistake: Concentrating on minor syntax errors while missing logical flaws.

Syntax issues are easy to spot and can sometimes overshadow deeper design or logical errors—especially when automated linters flag them immediately. Overemphasizing small style points may cause reviewers to gloss over critical code mistakes in how data flows or how functions interact.

#### Solution: Encourage reviewers to prioritize functionality and logic over superficial issues.

- **Separate Style Checks**  
  Use automated code review tools to handle formatting. This frees up human reviewers to focus on logic.
- **Apply a Review Checklist**  
  Incorporate questions about business logic, performance, and security, not just style.
- **Educate the Team**  
  Regularly remind everyone that code review challenges often lie in higher-level logic, which no linter can fully capture.

---

### Ignoring Context or Requirements

#### Mistake: Reviewing code without understanding the problem it solves.

Reviewers sometimes dive into code without referencing the user story, design docs, or specs. As a result, critical code mistakes might be missed because the reviewer doesn't fully grasp the intended functionality.

#### Solution: Provide adequate documentation or context in pull requests.

- **Mandatory Descriptions**  
  Pull requests should include a clear problem statement, links to tickets, and expected outcomes.
- **Tag Relevant Issues**  
  If you use a project management tool like Jira or Trello, provide direct links so reviewers can see the broader context.
- **Ask for Clarification**  
  Don't hesitate to request additional details if requirements or objectives aren't crystal clear.

Having the right context at the right time also prevents context switching in your development process, which can otherwise slow teams down. Read more about [context switching](https://axolo.co/blog/p/true-cost-of-context-switching-in-developer-workflows) to understand how it affects productivity.

---

### Lack of Constructive Feedback

#### Mistake: Giving vague or overly critical feedback.

One of the biggest code review mistakes developers make is failing to provide actionable, empathetic feedback. Comments like "This is wrong" or "Rewrite this" without further guidance can create tension, leading to code review conflicts and diminishing the trust that's so vital for effective collaboration.

#### Solution: Use constructive, specific, and actionable comments.

- **Focus on the 'Why'**  
  Rather than just pointing out errors, explain the rationale behind suggested changes.
- **Propose Alternatives**  
  If you see code mistakes in logic or structure, offer alternative approaches or direct references to docs.
- **Balance Positive and Negative**  
  Commend good solutions or improvements, and then address the issues that need attention.

Cultivating a strong feedback culture often extends beyond code reviews. Daily standups or using the [best Slack standup bot](https://axolo.co/blog/p/best-slack-standup-bot-for-engineering-teams) can keep everyone aligned and engaged.

### Reviewing Too Much Code at Once

#### Mistake: Large pull requests lead to fatigue and missed issues.

Massive pull requests can overwhelm reviewers, increasing the likelihood of overlooked code mistakes. When PRs contain hundreds or thousands of lines, fatigue sets in, making thorough reviews nearly impossible.

#### Solution: Break down pull requests into manageable chunks.

- **Set PR Size Guidelines**  
  Agree on a limit for lines of code or functional scope per PR.
- **Encourage Incremental Commits**  
  Smaller, well-defined commits are easier to review and revert if needed.
- **Maintain a Regular Review Cadence**  
  Setting frequent, shorter review sessions prevents backlog buildup.

---

### Skipping Security or Performance Considerations

#### Mistake: Focusing on functionality while ignoring security and performance implications.

Teams often consider a pull request "good enough" if it works as intended. But ignoring potential security flaws or performance bottlenecks can be one of the most damaging code review mistakes in the long run.

#### Solution: Include security and performance checks in the review checklist.

- **Adopt a Security Mindset**  
  Build threat modeling into your manual code review process. Ask how an attacker could misuse the feature.
- **Profile for Performance**  
  Encourage developers to assess time complexity, memory usage, and potential load issues before finalizing.
- **Use a Code Review Checklist**  
  A dedicated checklist ensures consistent inspection of crucial areas. Check out our [code review checklist](https://axolo.co/blog/p/code-review-security-checklist) for more guidance.

### Being Too Lenient or Too Critical

#### Mistake: Letting mistakes slide or being overly strict, creating friction in the team.

Striking the right balance can be challenging. Being too lax allows common coding mistakes to go unchecked, while an overly strict approach can sap morale and stifle innovation—both scenarios leading to code review conflicts.

#### Solution: Balance review tone to be collaborative and constructive.

- **Define 'Blocker' vs. 'Non-Blocker'**  
  Clarify when a comment is a suggestion versus a requirement for merging, so small code mistakes don't hold up progress unnecessarily.
- **Encourage Teamwide Participation**  
  Multiple reviewers can prevent any single perspective from dominating and creating an imbalance.
- **Foster Psychological Safety**  
  Create an environment where developers feel safe pointing out potential code mistakes, no matter who wrote the code.

---

### Delayed Reviews

#### Mistake: Taking too long to review code, delaying progress.

Long review cycles lead to significant context switching, as developers switch tasks while waiting on feedback. This not only blocks merges but can introduce new code mistakes when developers resume partially completed tasks.

#### Solution: Set clear expectations for review timelines and prioritize code reviews.

- **Establish Response Windows**  
  For instance, require that reviews begin within 24 hours of a pull request's submission.
- **Leverage Reminders**  
  Automate Slack or [GitHub scheduled reminders](https://axolo.co/features/slack-github-pull-request-reminder) so reviews don't slip through the cracks.
- **Incentivize Prompt Feedback**  
  Recognize and reward teams or individuals who consistently provide timely, quality reviews.

/>{" "}

Choosing between a manual code review process, an automated code review setup, or a hybrid of both involves considering your project's size, complexity, and the team's skill level. Each approach has its benefits and caveats:

### 1. Manual (Human) Reviews

Manual code review is the traditional route. Humans can spot nuanced code mistakes, architectural flaws, or unclear requirements that machines might miss. Yet, manual reviews can be time-consuming and prone to reviewer fatigue, especially if the team handles numerous pull requests daily.

### 2. Automated Reviews

Using automated code review solutions like ESLint, SonarQube, or CodeClimate speeds up the detection of syntax errors, style issues, and certain common coding mistakes. These tools shine by providing immediate feedback and ensuring consistency. However, automation alone can't fully grasp business logic or complex architectural considerations.

### 3. Hybrid Reviews

Many teams find the sweet spot in a hybrid approach: let automated code review handle repetitive checks, while human reviewers focus on logic, design patterns, and potential code review challenges that require deeper analysis. This division of labor maximizes efficiency and minimizes coding mistakes slipping through the cracks.

### 4. AI-Powered Code Reviews

Emerging AI-driven solutions are taking automation a step further. These tools can sometimes suggest fixes, detect suspicious patterns in large codebases, and learn from past merges to predict potential code mistakes. While AI code review platforms are still evolving, they're worth exploring if you're aiming to enhance your existing code reviews best practices.
