## Why Code Reviews Matter

Before dissecting the typical _code review mistakes_, let’s emphasize _why code reviews matter_ so much in any development life cycle. Here are a few critical _benefits of code reviews_:

1. **Ensures Code Quality**  
   By catching _coding mistakes_ during peer review, you can substantially reduce the risk of bugs in production. This early feedback loop helps maintain a healthy, consistent codebase.

2. **Promotes Team Alignment**  
   When everyone routinely reviews each other’s code, knowledge gets shared, and developers gain insights into different parts of the system. This fosters team coherence and fewer _code review conflicts_.

3. **Encourages Best Practices**  
   Code reviews serve as a platform to reinforce _code reviews best practices_. Senior developers can guide junior developers on _common coding mistakes_, security considerations, and performance optimizations.

4. **Reduces Overall Costs**  
   The costs of debugging _code mistakes_ skyrocket once software is in production. Systematic code reviews help identify issues early and minimize rework down the road.

5. **Builds a Stronger Feedback Culture**  
   Constructive reviews build trust and an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas, discussing _code review challenges_, and focusing on continuous improvement.

Ultimately, an organized _code review_ ([read more](https://axolo.co/)) process—whether it’s done via _manual code review_ or enhanced with _automated code review_—pays huge dividends, especially in complex projects. By ensuring the right checks, you’ll catch _coding mistakes_, mitigate future issues, and enhance team collaboration.

## Common Code Review Mistakes Developers Make

Despite the _benefits of code reviews_, it’s all too easy to slip into inefficient or unproductive practices. Below are the core _code review mistakes_ that commonly derail teams, each followed by actionable fixes.

### Overlooking Code Standards

#### Mistake: Failing to adhere to coding guidelines and standards.

Among the most pervasive _code review mistakes_ is ignoring established coding conventions. Each development team typically has a style guide—either an internal document or a popular industry standard. However, when reviewers don’t enforce these guidelines consistently, _coding mistakes_ that violate style or format can slip through, creating fragmentation and even _code review conflicts_ over time.

#### Solution: Establish clear coding standards and use linters/formatters to automate checks.

- **Document Your Guidelines**  
  Create or adopt a widely recognized style guide (e.g., Airbnb for JavaScript) to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Automate with Linters**  
  Incorporate linting tools, like ESLint or RuboCop, directly into your CI pipeline for immediate feedback on style-based _code mistakes_.
- **Reference Standards in PR Templates**  
  Remind developers about your coding standards by linking them within pull request templates.

### Reviewing Only Newly Added Code

#### Mistake: Focusing solely on new or changed code can lead to a fragmented understanding of the codebase.

It’s tempting to zero in exclusively on fresh diffs. While this approach might seem time-efficient, it risks overlooking how new changes integrate with existing logic or architecture. This siloed review can lead to overlooked _code mistakes_ that surface much later.

#### Solution: Review the entire codebase context to ensure that new changes integrate seamlessly with existing code.

- **Expand the View**  
  Many Git platforms let you expand surrounding lines in a diff. Use this to evaluate the context of the changes.
- **Cross-File Checks**  
  If a pull request touches multiple areas, glance through all relevant files to catch cross-cutting _coding mistakes_.
- **Encourage Discussion**  
  If something seems off or ambiguous, ask questions in the code review comments to avoid larger _code review conflicts_ later.

---

### Focusing Only on Syntax, Not Logic

#### Mistake: Concentrating on minor syntax errors while missing logical flaws.

Syntax issues are easy to spot and can sometimes overshadow deeper design or logical errors—especially when automated linters flag them immediately. Overemphasizing small style points may cause reviewers to gloss over critical _code mistakes_ in how data flows or how functions interact.

#### Solution: Encourage reviewers to prioritize functionality and logic over superficial issues.

- **Separate Style Checks**  
  Use _automated code review_ tools to handle formatting. This frees up human reviewers to focus on logic.
- **Apply a Review Checklist**  
  Incorporate questions about business logic, performance, and security, not just style.
- **Educate the Team**  
  Regularly remind everyone that _code review challenges_ often lie in higher-level logic, which no linter can fully capture.

---

### Ignoring Context or Requirements

#### Mistake: Reviewing code without understanding the problem it solves.

Reviewers sometimes dive into code without referencing the user story, design docs, or specs. As a result, critical _code mistakes_ might be missed because the reviewer doesn’t fully grasp the intended functionality.

#### Solution: Provide adequate documentation or context in pull requests.

- **Mandatory Descriptions**  
  Pull requests should include a clear problem statement, links to tickets, and expected outcomes.
- **Tag Relevant Issues**  
  If you use a project management tool like Jira or Trello, provide direct links so reviewers can see the broader context.
- **Ask for Clarification**  
  Don’t hesitate to request additional details if requirements or objectives aren’t crystal clear.

Having the right context at the right time also prevents _context switching_ in your development process, which can otherwise slow teams down. Read more about [context switching](https://axolo.co/blog/p/true-cost-of-context-switching-in-developer-workflows) to understand how it affects productivity.

### Lack of Constructive Feedback

#### Mistake: Giving vague or overly critical feedback.

One of the biggest _code review mistakes developers make_ is failing to provide actionable, empathetic feedback. Comments like “This is wrong” or “Rewrite this” without further guidance can create tension, leading to _code review conflicts_ and diminishing the trust that’s so vital for effective collaboration.

#### Solution: Use constructive, specific, and actionable comments.

- **Focus on the ‘Why’**  
  Rather than just pointing out errors, explain the rationale behind suggested changes.
- **Propose Alternatives**  
  If you see _code mistakes_ in logic or structure, offer alternative approaches or direct references to docs.
- **Balance Positive and Negative**  
  Commend good solutions or improvements, and then address the issues that need attention.

Cultivating a strong feedback culture often extends beyond code reviews. Daily standups or using the [best Slack standup bot](https://axolo.co/blog/p/best-slack-standup-bot-for-engineering-teams) can keep everyone aligned and engaged.

### Reviewing Too Much Code at Once

#### Mistake: Large pull requests lead to fatigue and missed issues.

Massive pull requests can overwhelm reviewers, increasing the likelihood of overlooked _code mistakes_. When PRs contain hundreds or thousands of lines, fatigue sets in, making thorough reviews nearly impossible.

#### Solution: Break down pull requests into manageable chunks.

- **Set PR Size Guidelines**  
  Agree on a limit for lines of code or functional scope per PR.
- **Encourage Incremental Commits**  
  Smaller, well-defined commits are easier to review and revert if needed.
- **Maintain a Regular Review Cadence**  
  Setting frequent, shorter review sessions prevents backlog buildup.

---

### Skipping Security or Performance Considerations

#### Mistake: Focusing on functionality while ignoring security and performance implications.

Teams often consider a pull request “good enough” if it works as intended. But ignoring potential security flaws or performance bottlenecks can be one of the most damaging _code review mistakes_ in the long run.

#### Solution: Include security and performance checks in the review checklist.

- **Adopt a Security Mindset**  
  Build threat modeling into your _manual code review_ process. Ask how an attacker could misuse the feature.
- **Profile for Performance**  
  Encourage developers to assess time complexity, memory usage, and potential load issues before finalizing.
- **Use a Code Review Checklist**  
  A dedicated checklist ensures consistent inspection of crucial areas. Check out our [code review checklist](https://axolo.co/blog/p/code-review-security-checklist) for more guidance.

### Being Too Lenient or Too Critical

#### Mistake: Letting mistakes slide or being overly strict, creating friction in the team.

Striking the right balance can be challenging. Being too lax allows _common coding mistakes_ to go unchecked, while an overly strict approach can sap morale and stifle innovation—both scenarios leading to _code review conflicts_.

#### Solution: Balance review tone to be collaborative and constructive.

- **Define ‘Blocker’ vs. ‘Non-Blocker’**  
  Clarify when a comment is a suggestion versus a requirement for merging, so small _code mistakes_ don’t hold up progress unnecessarily.
- **Encourage Teamwide Participation**  
  Multiple reviewers can prevent any single perspective from dominating and creating an imbalance.
- **Foster Psychological Safety**  
  Create an environment where developers feel safe pointing out potential _code mistakes_, no matter who wrote the code.

---

### Delayed Reviews

#### Mistake: Taking too long to review code, delaying progress.

Long review cycles lead to significant _context switching_, as developers switch tasks while waiting on feedback. This not only blocks merges but can introduce new _code mistakes_ when developers resume partially completed tasks.

#### Solution: Set clear expectations for review timelines and prioritize code reviews.

- **Establish Response Windows**  
  For instance, require that reviews begin within 24 hours of a pull request’s submission.
- **Leverage Reminders**  
  Automate Slack or [GitHub scheduled reminders](https://axolo.co/features/slack-github-pull-request-reminder) so reviews don’t slip through the cracks.
- **Incentivize Prompt Feedback**  
  Recognize and reward teams or individuals who consistently provide timely, quality reviews.

## Human, Automated, or Hybrid Code Review?

![automated code review](# "automated code review")

Choosing between a _manual code review_ process, an _automated code review_ setup, or a hybrid of both involves considering your project’s size, complexity, and the team’s skill level. Each approach has its benefits and caveats:

### 1. Manual (Human) Reviews

_Manual code review_ is the traditional route. Humans can spot nuanced _code mistakes_, architectural flaws, or unclear requirements that machines might miss. Yet, manual reviews can be time-consuming and prone to reviewer fatigue, especially if the team handles numerous pull requests daily.

### 2. Automated Reviews

Using _automated code review_ solutions like ESLint, SonarQube, or CodeClimate speeds up the detection of syntax errors, style issues, and certain _common coding mistakes_. These tools shine by providing immediate feedback and ensuring consistency. However, automation alone can’t fully grasp business logic or complex architectural considerations.

### 3. Hybrid Reviews

Many teams find the sweet spot in a hybrid approach: let _automated code review_ handle repetitive checks, while human reviewers focus on logic, design patterns, and potential _code review challenges_ that require deeper analysis. This division of labor maximizes efficiency and minimizes _coding mistakes_ slipping through the cracks.

### 4. AI-Powered Code Reviews

Emerging AI-driven solutions are taking automation a step further. These tools can sometimes suggest fixes, detect suspicious patterns in large codebases, and learn from past merges to predict potential _code mistakes_. While AI code review platforms are still evolving, they’re worth exploring if you’re aiming to enhance your existing _code reviews best practices_. For an in-depth look at the possibilities, see our piece on [AI code review](https://axolo.co/blog/p/comprehensive-ai-code-review-top-5-tools-to-automate-and-improve-code-quality).
