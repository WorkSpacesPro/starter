We are going to deep dive in the three ways to connect your engineering team into Slack with GitHub Enterprise and how to do it. The options are:

- Axolo, the collaborative application ([project incubated by Slack in 2023](https://axolo.co/blog/p/axolo-joins-slack-future-of-work-incubator)).
- GitHub Enterprise Server, the official integration,
- Toast, the personal notification bot.

## Axolo, the collaborative application

### What is Axolo?

In opposition to the other GitHub integrations, each pull request creates an ephemeral Slack channel. Instead of notifying a whole team, Axolo only invites reviewers and assignees and sends only the information that they need to see (comments, CI/CD, GitHub Action, deployments, checks) to process the pull request in due time.

/>

Each code comment will then create a thread in Slack, GitHub Enterprise Server and Slack are now synchronized. New messages, comments, and reviews will be sent to Slack and vice versa.

You can then setup daily reminders to avoid stale pull requests, create your own code reviewing time slots, receive CI/CD notifications in Slack, and much more! Looking for more information on Axolo? Discover more features in our [landing page](https://axolo.co)!

## Connect GitHub Enterprise Server with Slack by using webhooks

### What is GitHub Enterprise Server

GitHub Enterprise Server is a copy of the GitHub app for Slack dedicated to Enterprise customers.

This application will post commits, pull requests, and activity on GitHub Issues to a specific channel.

### How to connect GitHub Enterprise Server to Slack?

#### Step 1

In your GitHub account, select the repository you want to follow. Then, click on **Settings** in the navigation bar.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/github_step1.png"
    alt="GitHub Enterprise set up step 1"
    style={{ maxWidth: "450px" }}
  />
</div>

#### Step 2

In the left navigation, click on **Webhooks**, and press the **Add webhook** button.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/github_step2.png"
    alt="GitHub Enterprise set up step 1"
    style={{ maxWidth: "550px" }}
  />
</div>

#### Step 3

Paste `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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` as the Payload URL. Make sure that the **Content type** is `application/json` and the **SSL verification** is enabled. You can choose a wide range of events to trigger notifications, but for now, they only support commits, issues, and pull requests. Click on the **Add webhook** button.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/github_step3.png"
    alt="GitHub Enterprise set up step 1"
    style={{ maxWidth: "450px" }}
  />
</div>

#### Step 4

You can filter on a specific branch, choose which channel you want to send these notifications to, and personalize the label, name, and icon of your integrations.

## Toast, the personnal notification bot

### What is ToastE?

Toast is a Slack notification bot for GitHub. It sends alerts upon new pull request reviews, comments, and issues in your direct messages. ToastE is the enterprise version of Toast.

### How to set up ToastE
