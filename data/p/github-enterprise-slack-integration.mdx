Additionally, this integration ensures consistent updates and prioritization, helping each contributor stay focused on critical tasks. It also becomes simpler to link pull requests and issues, reducing context switching and speeding up the resolution cycle.

### Enhanced security and compliance monitoring.

Implementing a robust GitHub enterprise Slack integration helps maintain visibility into potential threats and ensures immediate response. Alerts on suspicious activities arrive instantly, allowing teams to address vulnerabilities before they escalate.

By leveraging this setup, your organization can track activity logs and potential risks in real time. This method complements your existing setup, ensuring each security alert is instantly accessible. This approach ensures your team benefits from the full potential of the integration, enabling deeper threat analysis.

## What are These Top 3 GitHub Enterprise Server and Slack Integrations

We are going to deep dive in the three ways to connect your engineering team into Slack with GitHub Enterprise and how to do it. The options are:

- Axolo, the collaborative application ([project incubated by Slack in 2023](https://axolo.co/blog/p/axolo-joins-slack-future-of-work-incubator)).
- GitHub Enterprise Server, the official integration,
- Toast, the personal notification bot.

### Axolo, the collaborative application

#### What is Axolo?

In opposition to the other GitHub integrations, each pull request creates an ephemeral Slack channel. Instead of notifying a whole team, Axolo only invites reviewers and assignees and sends only the information that they need to see (comments, CI/CD, GitHub Action, deployments, checks) to process the pull request in due time.

  alt="The Axolo way: subscribe to GitHub pull requests in Slack"
  classNameDiv="!mx-4 bg-white"
  classNameImage=""
  width={1200}
  height={480}
/>

Each code comment will then create a thread in Slack, GitHub Enterprise Server and Slack are now synchronized. New messages, comments, and reviews will be sent to Slack and vice versa.

/>

You can then setup [daily GitHub scheduled reminders](https://axolo.co/features/slack-github-pull-request-reminder) to avoid stale pull requests, organize your own [Slack standup bot](https://axolo.co/features/slack-standup-bot), create your own code reviewing time slots, receive [CI/CD test automation tools and notifications](https://axolo.co/features/github-action-slack-notifications) in Slack, and much more!

### Connect GitHub Enterprise Server with Slack by using webhooks

#### What is GitHub Enterprise Server

GitHub Enterprise Server is a copy of the GitHub app for Slack dedicated to Enterprise customers.

This application will post commits, pull requests, and activity on GitHub Issues to a specific channel.

#### How to connect GitHub Enterprise Server to Slack?

##### Step 1

In your GitHub account, select the repository you want to follow. Then, click on **Settings** in the navigation bar.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/github_step1.png"
    alt="github enterprise slack integration set up step 1"
    style={{ maxWidth: "450px" }}
  />
</div>

##### Step 2

In the left navigation, click on **Webhooks**, and press the **Add webhook** button.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>

  />
</div>

##### Step 3

Paste `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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` as the Payload URL. Make sure that the **Content type** is `application/json` and the **SSL verification** is enabled. You can choose a wide range of events to trigger notifications, but for now, they only support commits, issues, and pull requests. Click on the **Add webhook** button.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>

    alt="github enterprise slack integration set up step 3"
    style={{ maxWidth: "450px" }}
  />
</div>

##### Step 4

You can filter on a specific branch, choose which channel you want to send these notifications to, and personalize the label, name, and icon of your integrations.

### Toast, the personnal notification bot

#### What is ToastE?

Toast is a Slack notification bot for GitHub. It sends alerts upon new pull request reviews, comments, and issues in your direct messages. ToastE is the enterprise version of Toast.

## How to Choose the Right Integration for Your Team

Selecting the ideal **Slack GitHub Enterprise integration** requires evaluating your team’s development workflow, project scale, and communication preferences. Consider the kind of **GitHub Enterprise Slack notifications** that suit your needs—whether instant updates via direct alerts or discussions within ephemeral channels. Your organizational culture also plays a key role in determining the best fit.

For a simple **Slack GitHub Enterprise Server** setup, the native GitHub Enterprise webhook integration offers a hassle-free solution. However, teams seeking a more interactive collaboration experience might prefer an advanced **GitHub Enterprise Slack integration** like Axolo, which fosters deeper engagement around pull requests. Alternatively, Toast serves developers who value personal, direct message notifications for updates and changes.

## It’s the Right Time to Maximize Your Team’s Efficiency and Workflow with GitHub Enterprise Server and Slack Integration

Enhancing your team’s efficiency starts with a well-integrated **Slack GitHub Enterprise** workflow. By centralizing updates and reducing the need for constant context switching, your team stays informed and responsive. Developers can swiftly address code reviews, track commits, and manage merges directly within Slack.

With proactive **GitHub Enterprise Slack notifications**, teams avoid delayed pull requests and ensure every code change gets the attention it deserves. Whether you opt for Axolo, GitHub Enterprise, or Toast, a streamlined **GitHub Enterprise Slack integration** enhances collaboration, scales your development pipeline, and accelerates release cycles. For those favoring **ephemeral channels** and structured discussions, Axolo remains an outstanding choice, delivering a seamless code review experience in Slack.
