## 1. Introduction to Slack and GitHub Integration

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} toHeading={4} asDisclosure />

### 1.1 What is Slack?

Alright, we're at 'What is Slack?' If you're on this page, it's safe to say you're probably not a stranger to this platform. However, let's ensure everyone is on the same level and start with the basics.

According to a <NoFollowLink url="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-name-2016-9?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=In%20a%20Twitter%20thread%20from,of%20All%20Conversation%20and%20Knowledge.%22">Business Insider article</NoFollowLink>, Slack stands for 'Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.' It's an enterprise software platform that was first introduced to the world in 2013 by Stewart Butterfield, Eric Costello, Cal Henderson, and Serguei Mourachov.

Interestingly, the journey of Slack is intertwined with a gaming company. <NoFollowLink url="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL-IdxmGuwrQtLal33eG33j7JHOA0q4rrPZZCgOQbldqVUC3gMe2zM5cUH4bcqHqePxLBmk85KlV-tnILz0i0lzT9tZCsgRERuEew1duVZhjVQzosK_7SXBA8sryjKwftCX4Z3e6QkhiaN7Q6K4axY1LnNVVrDDDhGd4Eqff8jXC">TechCrunch's article</NoFollowLink> narrates how Slack was originally a communication tool developed for a team working on an online game named 'Glitch.' When the game failed to make a mark, the team realized the tool they'd developed had a much broader appeal and could meet the communication needs of teams worldwide. Thus, Slack, as we know it, was born.

TODO IMAGE GLITCH

Fast forward to the present day, and Slack is no longer just a messaging platform. It's a comprehensive ecosystem for integrations, with the ability to consolidate numerous services â€” from GitHub to Google Drive to Trello, and so much more, as outlined on the <NoFollowLink url="https://slack.com/apps">Slack's official apps</NoFollowLink>page. For developers, Slack is an invaluable tool, transforming casual chats into productive development discussions, complete with code snippets, issue tracking, and even executing commands via Slack apps.

In essence, Slack is far more than a platform for chatting. It's a central hub designed to streamline your development workflow. And if you didn't know what Slack was... well, we promise we won't spill the beans to your fellow developers.

### 1.2 What is GitHub?

There are very high changes you also know what GitHub is. But let's take this opportunity to give you some fun facts and history about GitHub.
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It's the haven where developers store their projects and network with like minds. (Source Wikipedia 11.4)

Launched in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett, GitHub was not just another project hosting service. It was conceived with a mission to simplify collaboration among developers, foster innovation, and create a platform where developers could showcase their work to the world.

The inception of GitHub ushered in a new era of social coding. It transformed Git, a powerful but complex command-line tool, into a user-friendly platform that enabled developers to collaborate on projects irrespective of their geographical location.

With its commitment to fostering open-source projects, GitHub quickly became a popular platform among developers. Over time, it has grown into a vast repository of code with contributions from millions of users worldwide.

And here's an interesting tidbit: The octocat, GitHub's adorable mascot, was selected via a Twitter logo contest. A graphic designer named Simon Oxley submitted the winning design, which has since become one of the most recognizable symbols in the developer community. (Source Mend.io 11.5.)

In a nutshell, GitHub is more than just a website for hosting code. It's a platform where developers learn, collaborate, contribute, and shape the future of software. And if you weren't quite familiar with GitHub before... well, we hope this makes up for lost time!"
