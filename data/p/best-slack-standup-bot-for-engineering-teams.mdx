Standup meetings are a critical part of Agile software development methodologies. When held correctly, standups are very useful in understanding the current project status. Bots can help streamline standup meetings and make them more effective.

## What is Agile Methodology?

For many years, software companies relied on the [waterfall](https://www.oxagile.com/article/the-waterfall-model/) model to create applications. This method breaks development into separate stages—like analysis, design, development, testing, and implementation—each completed in order, one after the other. While straightforward, it has some significant drawbacks. Large projects often take months or even years to deliver, leaving little room for adjustment. Customer needs can shift during this time, driven by changes in the market. Unfortunately, the waterfall method’s rigid structure makes responding to these shifts almost impossible.

Unlike traditional approaches, [Agile](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) methodology introduces greater flexibility, allowing teams to respond to changing demands and deliver value in incremental steps.

## What is a standup?

Agile developers can follow different methodologies, the best-known ones being [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) and [Kanban](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/priming-kanban-jesper-boeg/). Most of them mandate a daily huddle called a “standup.” This meeting is kept short (Scrum recommends a maximum of 15 minutes), so participants remain standing.

All the core team members attend the standup. Standups vary with teams, but a common agenda is that everyone talks about:

- What they worked on yesterday
- What they are going to work on today
- What issues are blocking them

This data enables the team to assess whether they are on schedule to meet their commitments.

## How to run a standup

A well-run standup not only provides status but also inspires and invigorates the team. Team members should come prepared with their updates and keep them brief and relevant.

Any significant issues that come up should not be addressed in the standup. The team should schedule other meetings to discuss them. Impediments that require coordination with other departments (such as Product or IT) are typically handled by a Project Manager or Scrum Master.

Some other tips for running great standup meetings are to hold them at the same time and place every day, begin and end on time, and periodically review their effectiveness at the retrospectives.

## The best Slack standup bot for engineering teams

While beneficial, the daily standups can be monotonous and energy-sapping. Using software bots to asynchronously record responses to the three standard questions can alleviate this. Here is an opiniated shortlist of four Standup Bot for Slack:
