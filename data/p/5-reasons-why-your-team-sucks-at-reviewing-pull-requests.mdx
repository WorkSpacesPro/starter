Do you think you reviewers leave your pull requests unnoticed on purpose? Is continuously asking for code reviews creating a small but persistent nevrose in your day-to-day?

<span className="rainbow-button text-2xl font-bold hover:cursor-auto">GREAT!</span>

Let's list why your team sucks at reviewing pull requests, and what you can do to improve it (before quitting your job).

## Everyone is handling code reviews notifications differently

Not having the same notification system for code reviews is usually the #1 reason why your team sucks at reviewing pull requests.

### Email notifications or GitHub/GitLab notifications are not adapted

#### Email notification, please stop

"Alex requested your review on her pull request." just hitted my inbox. Only 48 unseen emails to read before I can start my day and review her PR. What a glorious day!

Email notifications might sound a good idea for some, but this quickly becomes a nightmare. You can't filter them, you can't prioritize them, you can't even know if you already reviewed the PR or not. And they are lost within all the other fantastic emails you receive, like the 14 email from this recruiting agendy you never wrote to, or your last JS newsletter you subscribed to 2 years ago, but never opened.

#### GitHub/GitLab notifications are not adapted

I've been working as a developer for a few years now, and I've never seen a developer who felt like GitHub/GitLab notifications were adapted to their needs.

GitLab even called its notification system a "to-do list". Who needs another to-do list? I already have a to-do list for my personal life, and another one for my work life. I don't need a third one for my code reviews.

### Need to manually remind people in direct messages without context

Not knowing how your reviewers are notified about your pull requests often leads you to ... manually remind them in direct messages. All day. Everyday.

// funny gif?
HEY CHARLIE, THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'M REMINDING YOU TO REVIEW MY PR. I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T SEE MY LAST 2 REMINDERS.

Let's see why a dedicated tool will help you stay sane.

## Lack of a proper tool to help your team collaborate during code reviews

### Official GitHub & GitLab apps are outdated (too noisy) and hard to configure

Current GitHub & GitLab apps are outdated and hard to configure, they have major issues:

- They are too noisy,
- They are hard to configure.

#### Official apps are too noisy

Not everyone in your team needs to know about your new pull request. You don't want to spam them, and you don't want them to spam your.

PR notifications (especially reviews, CI/CD, and code comments) should only concerne the PR author, assignees and reviewers. Sending these notifications to a team channel is a bad idea. Another bad idea? Receiving notifications FOR YOU OWN ACTIONS.

// image github notification in slack for own comment
YES I KNOW, THANK YOU GITHUB BOT THIS IS ME WHO WROTE THIS COMMENT.

#### Official apps are hard to configure when you start with them

When you start using GitHub or GitLab, you don't know what you need. You don't know what you want. You don't know what you don't know.

"I know that I know nothin" - some bearded wise Greek dude, probably.

These collaborative features should be easier to configure, and start with an opiniated default configuration.

### Implementing a custom solution is time-consuming and costly

// drake meme here

A meme is worth a thousand words.

Implementing a custom solution is time-consuming and costly. You need to find a developer in your team that has time to do it, then you need to keep track of API updates, make sure your service stay online, and make sure it's secure.

Usually, you think that you have some specials needs and request, but trust me, even if each engineering team is unique, 99% of what you need can be generalized by a dedicated SaaS.

Using a dedicated tool is often a better option.

### You should try dedicated tools to collaborate during code reviews

## Lack of dedicated time set aside for reviews

## Not assigning specific reviewers for each pull request

### This creates bottlenecks and delays the review process

### You should create a process

=> code owners for automatic assignment
=> automatic reminders if no review, and after review

## Failing to maintain a culture of open communication and collaboration among team members.

### This can creates animosity and a low willingness to review each other's code

### Code review is a great opportunity to learn from each other

### You should create a culture of open communication and collaboration
