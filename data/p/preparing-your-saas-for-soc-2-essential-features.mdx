Today, trust is the new currency. As more businesses migrate to cloud-based solutions, the need for robust security and compliance measures has never been more paramount. Enter SOC-2, a certification that has rapidly become the gold standard for SaaS companies aiming to demonstrate their commitment to security and data protection.

For those unfamiliar, SOC-2 isn't just another acronym to add to the ever-growing list in the tech world. It's a rigorous framework designed to ensure that companies handle customer data with the utmost care and diligence (especially in the US, ISO 27001 is more EU focused). But, much like preparing for a marathon, achieving SOC-2 compliance isn't something that happens overnight. It requires foresight, planning, and a proactive approach.

So, where does one start? Before diving deep into the technicalities, it's essential to understand the five foundational pillars of SOC-2. These five pillars, or criteria, are the backbone of the certification, guiding companies on the path to better security and data management.

In this article, we'll demystify the five pillars of SOC-2 and provide a roadmap of features that SaaS companies can start building today to set themselves up for a smoother SOC-2 journey tomorrow.

  Every company does not need to implement every feature. Understanding the pillars will help you
  understand which features are relevant to your company. There is little chance your company need
  to be top notch in all five pillars. If you're not sure you need a feature, you should contact a
  SOC-2 auditor and start a process with a specialist (because you will probably end with such
  specialist).

## Features to Build to prepare for SOC-2

### Access Control

#### User Authentication

- **Definition:** Implementing methods to verify the identity of users trying to access the system.
- **Tips for Founders:**
  - Consider integrating third-party authentication providers like Auth0 or Okta to streamline the process.
  - Always offer multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an option, if not a requirement. For instance, SMS codes, authenticator apps, or hardware tokens can enhance security.
  - Educate users on the importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks of password reuse.

#### User Authorization

- **Definition:** Determining what actions or resources a verified user is allowed to access.
- **Tips for Founders:**
  - Understand the difference between Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). While RBAC assigns permissions based on roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer), ABAC uses attributes (e.g., user department, time of access) to determine permissions.
  - Use existing platforms or libraries that support these models to avoid building from scratch. For instance, AWS offers fine-grained access control with its IAM policies.
  - Regularly review and update roles, especially when introducing new features or services.

#### Session Management

- **Definition:** Managing a user's active session after they've logged in, ensuring it remains secure and terminates appropriately.
- **Tips for Founders:**
  - Implement automatic session timeouts. This ensures that if a user leaves their device unattended, unauthorized users can't continue the session.
  - Use session encryption to protect data during transit. Libraries like `express-session` for Node.js can help manage and secure user sessions.
  - Provide users with a list of active sessions (like what devices they're logged in on) and allow them to terminate any they don't recognize.

#### Access Reviews

- **Definition:** Periodic checks to ensure users have the appropriate level of access and that no unnecessary permissions exist.
- **Tips for Founders:**
  - Schedule regular access reviews, especially after personnel changes. An employee shifting roles might no longer need access to certain data or tools.
  - Use automated tools or platforms that can provide reports on user permissions, making reviews more efficient.
  - Encourage a culture of "least privilege" – granting only the permissions necessary to perform a task.
