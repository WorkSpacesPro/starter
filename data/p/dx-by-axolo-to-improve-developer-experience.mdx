We've been working with developers for more than 2 years now. We started Axolo as a way to help developer reduce code review fatigue and give reviewers a tool to help them review faster.

Everyday, we're learning more about what developers think is a great environment to work, and today we want to give them a voice to improve how their company shape their work environment with our latest free product: DX by Axolo.

Engineering managers lack key insights into their team's work environment. The main three points we want to help managers with are:

- How can I identify our team's bottleneck?
- How to make sure everyone is aligned?
- How can I track my team's progress?

DX by Axolo is designed to be a free tool to help developers share what they think is working great, and what need to be improved at work.

### DX by Axolo sends weekly survey to your team

Each sequence is focused on a specific engineering theme (code review, engineering processes, testing, company organization) to make your developer feedback insightful.

### It takes less than 5 minutes to complete a sequence

As we designed each weekly sequence on a specific theme, developers won't loose their time answering a multitude of questions. One sequence is only composed of questions on the same topic.

### As we believe in transparency, after completion, everyone has access to the results

We believe that transparency is the beginning of creating a productive and collaborative work environment. That's why every member of your team can see how their responses contribute to a larger understanding of what drives satisfaction and success.
