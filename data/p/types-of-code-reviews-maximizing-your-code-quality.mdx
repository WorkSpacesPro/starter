## Types of Code Reviews for Better Performance

<YellowCalloutBox emoji="ðŸ’¡" title="Purpose of code review">
  It's important to understand why we review code in the first place. Reviewing is important to
  improve code quality, enforce standards, and catch bugs before production. Also, code review helps
  sharing experiences among your team and encourage collaboration.
</YellowCalloutBox>

There are several **types of code reviews**, each aimed at improving code quality and performance. Teams often choose their code review methods based on project size, team dynamics, and complexity. Here are some of the most common types of code reviews used to ensure high-quality code and better team collaboration:

- **Formal Code Review** â€“ A structured and systematic process defined by specific guidelines, it often involves meetings to discuss the code.
- **Lightweight Code Review** â€“ A quick and informal review, focused on speed without sacrificing quality. Includes methods like **pair programming** and **team code reviews**.
- **Asynchronous Code Review** â€“ A flexible review process where team members review code at different times, typically using tools, which is ideal for distributed or large teams.
- **Tool-Assisted Code Review** â€“ Utilizes software to automate parts of the review, enhancing speed and catching common issues like style and syntax errors.
- **Pull Request Code Review** â€“ Popular in Git-based workflows, where code changes are reviewed through pull requests before merging into the main branch.
- **Stacked Pull Requests** â€“ If you understand pull request, it's a more advanced approach that breaks large changes into smaller pull requests, basically, you open a pull request on top of another pull request.

Each method offers unique **benefits of code review**, allowing teams to choose the technique that best fits their workflow.

### Formal Code Review

**Formal code review** is a structured, comprehensive process in which team members follow pre-defined roles and review guidelines. Usually done in meetings and can be highly detailed, it often involves multiple reviewers, which takes time. Itâ€™s a classic approach in **code review in software engineering**, and it focuses on improving the **quality of the code** and preventing defects early in the development cycle.

I recommend this review process for large and critical projects where no mistake can happen. By examining the code line-by-line, formal reviews help ensure compliance with coding standards, security, and overall **code quality**.

**Pros:**

- Ensures a thorough and deep review of code, which improves long-term code quality.
- Facilitates team-wide learning by providing detailed feedback and discussion opportunities.
- Effective in identifying complex logic or design flaws early.

**Cons:**

- Time-consuming, which can slow down development cycles.
- Requires scheduling meetings, making it less flexible for distributed or asynchronous teams.
- Can be overly rigid, especially for smaller, less complex code changes.

Formal code reviews are essential in certain environments but may not suit every team. Integrating **code review software** can help streamline this process and reduce manual effort.

### Lightweight Code Review

**Lightweight code reviews** are informal, quick, and highly flexible. Unlike formal reviews, they do not require strict processes or scheduled meetings. These reviews focus on speed and frequent feedback, making them ideal for smaller teams or agile workflows. Developers can conduct lightweight reviews using tools like email, chat, or version control platforms. This approach promotes continuous code improvement without significantly slowing down the development process.

There are several specific code review techniques under this category, including **pair programming**, **team code reviews**, **asynchronous code reviews**, and **tool-assisted code reviews**.

  height={539}
/>

#### Pair Programming

**Pair programming** is a technique where two developers work together on the same piece of code. It's when a developer writes the code, while the other reviews at the same time. The reviewer provides instant feedback and suggestions. This method enhances collaboration and problem-solving on the spot, and also helps the developer if they're less experienced.

**Pros:**

- Immediate feedback and collaboration improve code quality.
- Helps spread knowledge between team members.

**Cons:**

- Can be time-consuming with two developers focused on one task.
- Not always practical for larger teams or time-sensitive projects.

#### Team Code Review

**Team code reviews** involve multiple developers reviewing a single piece of code together. This process can happen either in a meeting or through asynchronous comments within a code review tool. Having more eyes on the code improves the chance of catching bugs or potential issues.

**Pros:**

- Multiple perspectives help catch more bugs and improve quality.
- Encourages team-wide learning and collaboration.

**Cons:**

- Can be slow if many reviewers are involved.
- Requires coordination and may delay changes if feedback is not timely.

#### Asynchronous Code Review

**Asynchronous code reviews** let team members check code whenever they have time, instead of doing it together in real-time or in meetings. This works well for teams in different locations or when using tools like GitHub, where developers can leave comments on code changes whenever they are free.

**Pros:**

- Offers flexibility, especially for distributed or remote teams.
- Reduces the need for live meetings, speeding up the workflow.

**Cons:**

- Delayed feedback can slow down the process.
- Lack of immediate discussion can lead to misunderstandings.

#### Tool-Assisted Code Review

**Tool-assisted code reviews** use software to help with the process by automatically checking for mistakes, making sure the code follows rules, or spotting security issues. This makes the review easier and keeps the code consistent across the project.

**Pros:**

- Automated tools improve speed and reduce human error.
- Easily integrated into existing workflows using **best code review tools**.

**Cons:**

- Tools can miss complex issues or design flaws that require human insight.
- Initial setup of DevOps code review tools can require time and resources.

Lightweight code reviews are a simple and effective way to keep code quality high. By using the right approachâ€”like pair programming, asynchronous reviews, or GitHub toolsâ€”teams can make the review process easier while still keeping the quality of the code strong.

### Pull Requests for Change-Based Code Review

**Pull requests** are the most widely used methods for [code reviews](https://axolo.co) in tech teams (especially in Git-based workflows). How does it work? Developers submit a pull request (PR) to propose changes. Someone else (the reviewer) then review the code, leaving comments and suggesting improvements before the changes are merged into the main branch.

PR are tightly integrated with version control systems like **GitHub** and are often supported by **code review software** that facilitates inline comments and discussions. This method is super useful for ensuring that all changes are reviewed before being merged.

/>

**Advantages of Pull Request Code Reviews:**

- Encourages collaboration and feedback, often through comments and discussions directly within the pull request.
- Provides a clear, trackable history of changes, with all code alterations visible and recorded.
- Is beneficitial for integration and delivery (CI/CD), it allows teams to incorporate smaller, incremental changes into the project, and is often well integrated with DevOps code review tools.

**Disadvantages of Pull Request Code Reviews:**

- Can slow down development if the pull requests are large or if reviewers are not available.
- Reviews may become superficial if team members are overloaded with pull requests, leading to missed issues.
- PRs require familiarity with version control tools (like Git), which is not always simple for new developers (but higly recommended).

Pull requests provide a structured yet flexible method for **change-based code reviews**, making them a cornerstone of workflows in **DevOps** and agile environments. For teams using platforms like **GitHub**, tools such as **GitHub pull request code review** features offer seamless integration and improved collaboration across teams.

If you're looking for a quick way to start with pull requests, I recommend you discover our [pull request templates](https://axolo.co/blog/p/part-3-github-pull-request-template).

### Stacked Pull Requests: An Improved Way to Do Pull Request Code Reviews

**Stacked pull requests** are an advanced technique used to manage large or complex code changes by breaking them into smaller pull requests (which are more manageable). Instead of submitting one massive pull request with big changes, developers create a series of "stacked" pull requests on each other. Each PR is reviewed and merged independantly which ease the code review process.

This approach allows teams to handle interdependent changes more efficiently, particularly in fast-moving projects where continuous integration is key. Stacked pull requests also help maintain a clean and organized commit history, improving overall project maintainability.

**Advantages of Stacked Pull Requests:**

- **Easier to review**: Smaller PRs are easier to review than one huge PR. Breaking large changes will help your reviewer (they will thank you).
- **Improved feedback**: As it easier, you reviewers will be able to provde a more focused feedback on your changes.
- **Faster merging**: As the process runs more smoothly, these small PRs will be merged faster.

**Disadvantages of Stacked Pull Requests:**

- **Requires careful management**: Mismanaging the order of pull requests can lead to confusion or integration issues, especially if changes are dependent on one another.
- **Complexity for new developers**: Stacked pull requests can be confusing for team members unfamiliar with the process, requiring extra onboarding and guidance.
- **Potential for merge conflicts**: The more pull requests you open, the higher risk of dealing with merge conflict you got. So you should merge them as fast as you can.

By using **stacked pull requests**, teams can streamline the code review process, making it easier to manage complex changes. This technique is especially useful for larger teams or projects that require **continuous integration** and rapid iterations.
