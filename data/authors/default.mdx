### Where I'm from

I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³. I am the eldest brother, and from a young age, I have always been conscious and responsible, striving to learn and work hard

### What I do now

Currently, I work for [NAB](https://www.nab.com.au/) and responsible for being a Back-End Engineer. In particular, develop and support the payment acceptance solutions that we have in market for when cardholders are present (i.e. terminals) and for when cardholders are not present (i.e. online, over the phone or by mail order)

### Where I'm at now

Today, I still live in Ho Chi Minh City, Even though I have been living here for long time but I still haven't explored all the interesting things in this city
