Krzysztof Janiec is a software engineer from Poland. I have more than 10 years of experience in full-stack apps development.

Currently, I work in IoT field, but I also worked in e-commerce or whole ERP (finance, logistics and so on) projects.

I'm a remote developer because of ergonomics - (I every day use a treadmill, I also have a standing desk with 3 external displays). If remote work is an issue for you, probably I'm not a good candidate ;)

Skills, experience you have written below. I'll tell more about my workstation in a post on my blog.
