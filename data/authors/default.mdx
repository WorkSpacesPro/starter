## Welcome to My Blog

I’m **Rasjaad** I live in the Netherlands and am a professional software engineer. I have a passion for continuous
learning and creative side projects. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me in the
kitchen experimenting with new recipes, mixing up cocktails, or enjoying a good
game; online or offline! I love sharing knowledge and constantly developing
new skills.

This site, hosted on my very own homelab, is where I share my journey—
from tech adventures to personal hobbies and more.
