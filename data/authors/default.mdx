I enjoy and excel at designing and developing secure, usable and creative web + mobile applications and the APIs which power them.

I am experienced at transforming complex big picture visions into achievable, incremental development roadmaps.

I have lead several integrations with third parties and can communicate systems in a way which is understood by non-technical clients.

I have mentored both graduates and senior developers, conducted one-to-one catch-ups and code reviews.
