I am a software engineer at Omada Identity, a passionate developer who loves learning new technologies and sharing knowledge with others. I also enjoy writing articles about software development and collaborating on open-source projects.

In my free time, I like to watch movies and TV shows, participate in events in my town, and spend time with my family and friends.
