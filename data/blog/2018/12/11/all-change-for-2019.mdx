![All change for 2019](/content/images/2018/12/IMG_20181207_142108.jpg)

In January I am joining the [RoosterMoney](https://www.roostermoney.com/) team as a Senior Developer. I am specialising further into the latest backend Node.js+Typescript and taking a new step into FinTech and Financial Education. I'll be working on building awesome things for the RoosterMoney platform which reshapes the way families talk and engage with money around the world. I am excited to get started!

I have left [Lumina Learning](https://luminalearning.com/) where I was Lead and Senior Developer. Over the past 4 years I have transformed Lumina Learning's system into a modern platform made up of microservices which power digital web and mobile apps. This has allowed Lumina to provide innovative psychometrics, selection tools and integrations with third parties. I also grew, lead and mentored Lumina's software development team and put in place productive processes which I hope the company will benefit from for many years ahead.
