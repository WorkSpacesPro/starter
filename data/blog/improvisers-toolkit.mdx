# Improvisers Toolkit

***

This is the first part of my Stanford experience. I will share some insights and learnings from the course “Innovative Technology Leader” that I’ve attended in June 2024.

## Many strangers
Do you know that feeling when you’re having such a thing that is supposed to be going on over the next days and you are in a group of people that you’ve never seen before? So literally you do not any one?

This was exactly the feeling when I’ve entered the first lecture on the “Innovative Technology Leader” course beginning of June 2024. I had the good fortune that I’ve got granted this course in Stanford from the company that I work for. But let’s come back to the feelings that must of us have in such an environment. The word stress or anxiety comes to mind - at least for a person like me that does not enjoy to be on unknown territories. What does the others think? I guess it can be considered as sign of the quality of Stanford itself and especially this course, that it was considered that all people think like this and the first class addressed exactly this. After a brief introduction from the director of the class, Lisa entered the room and presented herself as a teacher about “improv” classes in Stanford. I have to admit that I was a bit puzzled and now even more afraid, “Will she now ask everyone to do some improvised theater - here in front of all others???” Well, at the end she did exactly this, but in much more gentle way.

The first exercise was to find a partner. The “usual way” with looking shammeshly to the person next to you and mumble “Hi, should we do this together?” Wasn’t allowed. Instead we should walk through the room, look someone, that we have never worked before, in the eyes and ask the loud and clearly: “Hi, my name is Peter. Do you wanna be my partner?” And the other person had to reply in an honored way, “Hi Peter (of course fill in here you’re name) it is an honor for me to be you’re partner my name is Zoltan.” If you hear people say, I’m not good with names, than Lisa’s clear answer is, “No you do not care!” Make an effort to learn the name! This is the first step in getting to know each other.

After finding a partner we started with an supposedly quite easy exercise. We as a group had to count until 3. The only complexity was that one person had to start and say “one” then the partner said “two” and the first says “three” and everything starts from the beginning. Please try it yourself with some one and you will figure out it is surprisingly hard and most likely there will be some laughter, because someone missed it or even failed.

## The Circus Bow
What Lisa now explained was a real eye opener for me. She asked every group, to cheer if the partner fails - do a high five and shout “Wohoooo”. There is not such a thing as a failure, especially not in this super low stake environment, so why do we try to hide and maybe even avoid to do something in the first round? The reason is actually simple, most cultures do not allow failures. They are something bad and if this happens you even need to apologize for it. But on the other hand, have you ever seen an acrobat in the circus who failed with something? Maybe a juggler dropping an item or an Trapez acrobat falling into the net? Do they flinch and try to hide? No, they bow. The do the circus bow. This indicates, “Hey I’m OK - no need to worry” and “The show must go on!” Just imagine they would try to hide and disappear from the stage...
Our work environment is in most cases comparable. Most decisions or presentations are at a low stake and there is even another reason why you should not try to hide after messing something up. We humans are exceptionally good in reading the body language of someone else and we take decisions based on it really quickly. We are looking for things like self competence and security, especially in leaders!
Coming back to the exercise - next round it got a bit harder. Instead of saying one, the respective person had to clap and even more important both had to cheer in case of an error. Next round clap, snap and saying three. Lastly clap, snap and stump with the foot. Many failures and a lot of cheering are guaranteed. This was a brilliant way to meet someone the first time.
## Sharing memories - some fake some real
Next exercise, of course with a new partner. Means walking again through room look someone in the face and find anew partner. This time we told our partner a fake history and she should reply in a corrective way. For example: “Hey do you remember the time that we hiked through Yellowstone?” And the partner replies with something like: “Hmmm, yeah I do remember us hiking - but this was in Yosemmitee.” The learning out of this was that it is quite complicated to keep a conversation ongoing with someone who is correcting or disagreeing all the time. We tend to correct people around us all the time, even if there is nothing to gain - but this comes to the cost that it can get harder and harder to find someone who wants to speak with you.
Next exercise, new partner of course. This time the task was to share a memory which was based on a given keyword. After sharing the memory give a new keyword for the partner and try to use only keywords with a positive to neutral co-notation. This helps a lot get to know someone, if the person is telling stories about their past. Next step was to bring together two groups and continue the exercise. Repeat until there are 8 ppl in one group.
It is pretty much magic, you don’t have the feeling anymore that you do not know any single face. There is now a full room of people who had laughed and cheered with each other and even told others about real memories that they have. After just 90 minutes I left the room and looked much more cheerful to the next classes - thank you Lisa for this experience!
