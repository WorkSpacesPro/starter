# What are we doing here?

**I makes mistakes. Lots of them.** I haven't always been okay with this, but I'm learning to embrace it.

I've known for a long time that I'm not the best at anything. I'd say that I'm average at most things. **Expect reflection - I'm confident I'm above average here.**

So at then end of the day I'm just a guy who makes mistakes and (usually) learns from them.

I also really like learning. I'm pretty good at this too. But I've never publically shared my mistakes, reflections, and learnings, so I've decided that a blog is the ideal forum to start doing these three things publically.

I'm hopeful that in being more open about my mistakes, reflections, and learnings you'll find a spark of inspiration to start or continue your own journey.

## Cool...so what's the point of this?

There are a couple reasons I'm starting doing this now. I'll try go make a case for each:

1. **To organize my thoughts**

Last week I was reflecting on all the projects I have going on any given day:
 - building a shed
 - starting a business (with a non-profit arm)
 - a webapp for teaching tech skills in Kenya and Haiti
 - diving deeper into machine learning and software development
 - installing chair railings in the hallways
 - building an automated aerated composter
 - learning advanced math
 - learning Swahili
 - trying to get back into shape
 - and I'm completely skipping over the fact that I'm also trying to re/build and or maintain relationships with my family and friends
 - I also have a full time job that sucks the energy out of me because capitalism

This led me to realize that:
 1. I have too many projects and not enough time.

   sidenote: I often ask myself *why* I have so many projects, and wonder if my time would be better spent meditating, reading, or just doing nothing. Maybe I'll write about this someday. *internal monologue: So we are just collecting projects now?*

 2. All these projects are great and I'm excited about them (except work, I'm not excited about work)
 3. I don't plan, track, or otherwise write down my ideas, reflections, and learnings. They just live in my head until one day they happen.
 4. I need to start organizing my thoughts. 

After reflecting on all of this I realized that the best possible thing that I could do was...start a blog?

2. to share my journey of learning and growing. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert at anything. I'm just going to share my journey of learning and growing.

3. to share my journey of learning and growing. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert at anything. I'm just going to share my journey of learning and growing.

Here’s what you can expect:
	1.	Authenticity Over Perfection:
This isn’t about getting everything right—it’s about learning in public. You’ll see my successes, failures, and everything in between.
	2.	A Focus on Growth:
The goal is progress, not mastery. I’m here to explore, improve, and reflect on what I learn along the way.
	3.	Real and Relatable Content:
Whether it’s blog posts, videos, or quick updates, I’ll share honest insights and practical takeaways from my experiences.
	4.	A Collaborative Space:
Your feedback, ideas, and experiences are welcome! Let’s learn from and with each other.
	5.	Celebrating Curiosity:
This is a judgment-free zone where curiosity leads the way. Mistakes are part of the process, and every misstep is a step toward understanding.
	6.	Adaptability and Growth:
This site will evolve as I learn, and I hope it inspires you to start (or continue) your own learning journey.
