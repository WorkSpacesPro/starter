This is my very first blog post! When I read blogs I always like to have a short summary on what the post is about.
So here goes:
This post is about my investing strategy. It will contain a set of rules and promises I will hold myself to when investing. It
will cover topics such as what is my investing goal, do's and don'ts, my risk tolerance, portfolio asset allocation and more.
The goal of this post is to have a reminder for myself on what I want to achieve and not to stray from the path!

# Why am I investing?

In the Netherlands, saving money for a pension is mandated by law. A percentage of our salary is reserved and put to a
pension fund. In the past, the government has increased the retirement age multiple times.
If I want to retire before the retirement age I have to pay a hefty fine on the money I receive out of the fund.
I want to invest to build up wealth such that I can either retire earlier or work less without a loss of income.
To guide me through the years and pitfalls of investing I have created an investing strategy that will help me through my investing journey.

# Time horizon

My time horizon will be at least 20 years. In 20 years from the date of this blog I will re-evaluate where I am in live
as well as in my investing journey. The current horizon should be long enough to make a decent profit and survive multiple crashes.

# Asset allocation

We will define the allocation of assets within my portfolio:

1. The division of assets should be as follows:

   1. A minimum of 70% in ETF's.
   2. Around 20% in stocks.
   3. There should be a portion of cash in case of stocks being on sale.
   4. I will only hold ETF's, stocks and cash.

2. The assets in the portfolio should be diversified over sectors and countries. A single sector cannot take
   up to more than 25% of the portfolio. For countries this cannot be more than 50%. The reason for countries is that it is
   harder to invest in countries in for example asia or africa due to not understanding their economics.

3. One type of currency cannot consist of more than 50% of the portfolio. I do not want to be fully dependant on one
   currency.

## Monthly contribution

Each month I will transfer at least €200,- into my investing account. The monthly contribution is not mandatory and should
not be used with money I do not have or need for other purposes. It is okay to put in more money, the goal should be to
at least transfer €2400,- a year.

# Re-balancing rules

I will look at the initial investment of a security rather than the profit that is made. If a stock or ETF grew significantly
I should not sell it because it takes up a big portion of my portfolio. The reason for selling a security should be
because the thesis I have during analysis does not hold anymore. Every half year or year, depending on what works best I
will re-balance the portfolio such that it adheres to the rules of [asset allocation](#asset-allocation).

# Managing Risk in My Portfolio

While I am mentally able to handle quite some risk, I would like to avoid it. I will manage my risk by staying away from
risky products like crypto, options and other leveraged products. There are also some rules that I will not invest
in companies that:

1. do not make a profit.
2. do not have a proven business model.
3. are over hyped.
4. are meme stocks.
5. I do not understand.

I also understand that my brain is wired to buy when a stock has increased in a short amount of time, which is why will
not act on the fluctuations of the market on itself.
These fluctuations do present opportunities which I will evaluate in the present, they should not be the sole reason for
buying or selling.

# Risky investments

I have thought about these rules and written them down as a commitment to myself. However I do know myself and I know I will be
tempted to buy options or crypto.
Allowing myself to buy these products has never played out well for me and I have decided to stay away from them.

# A summary of rules

- I will only buy stocks I did a fundamental analysis on and a valuation.
- I will rebalance my portfolio on regular intervals.
- I will not buy stocks that do not have a positive cashflow.
- I will not act on quarterly reports only on annual reports.
- I will look at quarterlies to see if the thesis still holds.
- I will not invest in companies that do not have a proven business model.
- I will not invest in companies I do not understand.
- I will not invest in meme/hype stocks.
- If I don't know what to invest in I will buy more of an ETF.
- I will not act on market fluctuations.
- I will only buy or sell based on the conclusions of my own analysis.

# An evolving document

This strategy is not set in stone. It is allowed to change, however the core of the strategy should not drastically change
over time. The history is kept in the git repository of this website.

# Commitment

This blog post is a commitment to myself. By writing and publishing this post I will adhere myself to the rules defined here.
