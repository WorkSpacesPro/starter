# Deploying Smart Contracts and Creating a Web3 React App

The process of creating and deploying a smart contract on a blockchain like Ethereum, and then integrating it into your React web application with a web3 wallet can be a challenging process. However, with the right tools and a step-by-step guide, you will be able to implement this smoothly.

## Step 1: Create Your Smart Contract

First, let's use Solidity to write our smart contract.

Here's a simple smart contract example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

contract SimpleContract {
    string public message;

    constructor(string memory initialMessage) public {
        message = initialMessage;
    }

    function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Compilation & Deployment with Hardhat

After the smart contract is written, we'll compile it using the Hardhat and then deploy it to an Ethereum testnet network.

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

Ensure you have your `hardhat.config.js` setup properly with the correct network configurations and private key.

## Step 3: Create & Configure Your React App

Next, let's start building our React app. First let's install `web3` library to enable communication with the Ethereum network:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install web3
```

### Connecting to Web3

In your React app, you can now connect to your web3 provider and access the deployed smart contract:

```javascript
import Web3 from 'web3';

let web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);

await window.ethereum.enable();

const contractAddress = '0x0'; // Deployed contract address
const contractABI = [...]; // ABI of the contract

let contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);
let message = await contract.methods.message().call();
```

And there you have it! This is just the beginning of what you can do with web3.js, React and Ethereum smart contracts. The decentralized web opens up a whole new world of possibilities for developers and users alike.
```
Note: You may replace the '0x0' for contract address with the deployed contract's address. Also, replace [...] with your contract's ABI.
