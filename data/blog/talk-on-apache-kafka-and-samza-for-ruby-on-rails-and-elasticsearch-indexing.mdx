In May I gave a talk at Doximity about some prototyping Iʼve been doing with Apache Kafka and Samza. Weʼve got the video together now, so check it out on the [Doximity Engineering blog](https://engineering.doximity.com/articles/video-apacha-kafka-and-samza) or our new [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtfE8_Ux2EY).
