# Introduction

This is both an example of a nested route located post and why you may want to use it.

## How To Do It

all you need to do is put a `.md`/`.mdx` file in a nested folder inside of the blog folder. for example this file path is `/data/blog/sample-post-in-nested-route.md`

## Why You Might want to do it

Flexible enough to use for many purposes, some potential uses could be

- Multipart posts under a common route
- Multiple authors
- Internationalization

## Potential Future Improvements

- previous/next post links at bottom of template would be better to be sorted by date and then grouped/sorted by nested route. so that when doing multipart posts it will take you to the next related post
