Hi ðŸ‘‹ once again it's been a while, so here's an update to kick off 2024!

Firstly, I've refreshed this blog, moving from Ghost to React with Next.js âœ¨ using an [excellent open source markdown blog starter](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It's also now hosted on Vercel instead of a Linode VPS.

At work I've been specialising in backend Node.js and TypeScript for the past 5 years and I'm currently a hands on Tech Lead ([see my about page](/about)). I'm balancing code and architecture with management of people and processes. I lead the parent squad to develop our in house recurring subscriptions platform which integrates a monthly offer for NatWest Group customers, and in child squad we've enabled the purchasing of multiple debit card designs for children.

Over Christmas I decided to give the frontend some love by [completing](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/certificate/65901004e3eb97f945de71b4) an excellent [React course](https://www.joyofreact.com/). With all this new knowledge I now plan on launching some new [side projects](/projects) soon - watch this space!

Last year I also [completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/B4W84WEFXNTQ) a course on [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) mainly to get a basic understanding of how these models work and can be trained, unsure if I'll do more in this space but it's a start.

In life it's often a challenge to find the time around dog walks and training, in the winter it's an early start and we're trying to train Oscar for Separation Anxiety as he's still unable to stay on his own.
Other things in life we've redecorated our lounge and dining area.

We're living in Bristol, in addition to exploring here and Somerset, we've had trips to the New Forest, Cotswolds, Peak District, Malvern Hills, Sugar Loaf in Abergavenny, Whitby.
